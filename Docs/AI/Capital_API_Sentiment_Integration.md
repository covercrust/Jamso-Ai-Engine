# Capital.com API Integration with Historical Sentiment Data

## Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Jamso AI Engine's Advanced Parameter Optimization Process (APOP) with Capital.com API integration, focusing on three key improvements:

1. **Historical Sentiment Data Integration**
2. **Optimization Dashboard**
3. **Scheduled Optimization with Performance Monitoring**

## 1. Historical Sentiment Data Integration

The historical sentiment data integration feature allows the trading strategy to incorporate sentiment analysis from multiple sources when making trading decisions. This provides a more robust approach compared to the previous constant sentiment value implementation.

### Components

- `sentiment_integration.py`: Core module that provides sentiment data access
  - Fetches sentiment data from Capital.com API
  - Generates simulated historical sentiment data
  - Stores sentiment data in an SQLite database
  - Combines multiple sentiment sources with weighted averaging

### Features

- **Multi-source sentiment**: Combines data from Capital.com client sentiment, social media sentiment, and news sentiment
- **Weighted integration**: Applies different weights to different sentiment sources based on reliability
- **Timeframe alignment**: Resamples sentiment data to match trading timeframes
- **Persistence**: Stores sentiment data in a database for efficient reuse

### Usage

```python
from src.AI.sentiment_integration import SentimentIntegration

# Initialize sentiment integration
sentiment = SentimentIntegration()

# Get sentiment data for a symbol
sentiment_series = sentiment.get_combined_sentiment_series(
    symbol="BTCUSD", 
    timeframe="HOUR",
    start_date="2023-08-01", 
    end_date="2023-08-31"
)

# Add sentiment to dataframe
df['sentiment'] = sentiment_series
```

## 2. Optimization Dashboard

A new dashboard has been implemented to visualize optimization results, track parameter evolution over time, and identify the best-performing strategies.

### Components

- `optimization_dashboard.py`: Interactive web-based dashboard using Dash and Plotly

### Features

- **Performance tracking**: Charts showing key metrics over time
- **Parameter evolution**: Visualizes how optimal parameters change over time
- **Comparison view**: Compare different symbols, timeframes, and objectives
- **Filtering**: Filter results by date range, symbol, and other criteria
- **Top strategies**: Identify top-performing strategies by return and Sharpe ratio

### Usage

```bash
# Start the dashboard
python src/AI/optimization_dashboard.py

# Start with specific results directory
python src/AI/optimization_dashboard.py --dir /path/to/results

# Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8050
```

## 3. Scheduled Optimization with Performance Monitoring

The scheduled optimization process runs parameter optimization on a regular basis, compares results over time, and alerts when performance degrades. This enables continuous strategy improvement and monitoring.

### Components

The existing `scheduled_optimization.py` script has been enhanced to support historical sentiment data integration.

### Features

- **Scheduled optimization**: Run optimizations on a regular schedule
- **Performance monitoring**: Track strategy performance over time
- **Degradation detection**: Alert when performance drops below a threshold
- **Email alerts**: Receive notifications when intervention is needed
- **Multiple asset classes**: Optimize parameters for different symbols
- **Multiple timeframes**: Support different trading timeframes

### Usage

```bash
# Run scheduled optimization daily
python src/AI/scheduled_optimization.py --interval 24 --symbols BTCUSD,EURUSD --timeframes HOUR,DAY

# Run with email alerts
python src/AI/scheduled_optimization.py --email-alerts
```

## Integration with Capital.com API

The improvements have been integrated with the existing Capital.com API client, providing a seamless experience. The system uses fallback mechanisms to handle API outages or dependency issues:

1. **Primary method**: Use standard Capital.com API client
2. **First fallback**: Use simplified fallback API client 
3. **Second fallback**: Use synthetic data generation

## Testing the Implementation

A test script has been created to validate the implementation:

```bash
# Run the test script
./Tools/test_sentiment_integration.sh
```

This script validates:
- Environment setup and credential configuration
- Sentiment data fetching and integration
- Parameter optimization with sentiment
- Dashboard functionality

## 4. Mobile Alerts for Performance Monitoring

The mobile alerts system enables real-time notifications about optimization results and performance issues, enhancing the monitoring capabilities of the optimization process.

### Components

- `mobile_alerts.py`: Core module that handles alert generation and delivery

### Features

- **Multi-channel notifications**: Supports email, SMS, push notifications, and webhooks
- **Priority levels**: Different alert levels (info, warning, critical) for appropriate escalation
- **Rich content**: Detailed performance metrics and parameters in notifications
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents alert fatigue with configurable rate limits
- **Scheduled integration**: Automatic alerts for optimization events

### Usage

```bash
# Run scheduled optimization with mobile alerts
python src/AI/scheduled_optimization.py --mobile-alerts --alert-level warning

# Test mobile alerts
./Tools/test_mobile_alerts.sh
```

For more details, see [Mobile Alerts Integration](Mobile_Alerts_Integration.md).

## Next Steps

The following enhancements are planned for future development:

1. **Real-time sentiment integration**: Connect to streaming sentiment data sources
2. **Sentiment prediction**: Use machine learning to predict future sentiment changes
3. **Anomaly detection**: Detect unusual patterns in sentiment data
4. **Custom sentiment sources**: Allow users to add custom sentiment data sources
5. **Custom notification templates**: Allow customization of alert formats and delivery rules

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the Advanced Parameter Optimization Process (APOP) by incorporating historical sentiment data, visualizing optimization results, and providing continuous monitoring. The system is now more robust, with multiple fallback mechanisms and better alerting capabilities.

The modular design ensures that additional data sources and optimization techniques can be easily integrated in the future.
