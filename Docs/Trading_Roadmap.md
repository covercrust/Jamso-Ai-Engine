### Roadmap to Trading Domination

#### Phase 1: Finalize TradingView Logic
1. Polish Pine Script Strategy:
   - Refine the `Jamso Enhanced Alert SuperTrend`.
   - Ensure robust risk management with take profit, stop loss, and trailing stops.
   - Debug and backtest thoroughly across asset classes (indices, forex, crypto).
   - Add advanced alert messages for webhook integration (include trade parameters, UUIDs).

2. Test Signal Generation:
   - Verify signals fire consistently for different market conditions.
   - Log alerts to ensure proper message structure (order size, action, SL/TP levels).

---

#### Phase 2: Enhance Python Webhook App
1. Core Functionalities:
   - Parse and validate webhook payloads.
   - Execute trades via the Capital.com API with accurate parameters.
   - Implement advanced order management (e.g., dynamic SL/TP adjustments).

2. Risk Management:
   - Include dynamic position sizing based on equity and SL distance.
   - Implement portfolio-level checks to prevent over-leveraging.

3. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Real-time logs for received alerts, executed trades, and errors.
   - Append performance data to logs for analytics (P/L, win rate, drawdown).

---

#### Phase 3: Integrate and Test
1. Sync TradingView and Python App:
   - Set up TradingView webhooks to send alerts to your Python app.
   - Verify end-to-end signal-to-execution flow.
   - Test with a sandbox broker environment.

2. Stress Testing:
   - Simulate high alert frequency to test the appâ€™s robustness.
   - Ensure minimal latency from signal to execution.

---

#### Phase 4: Deploy and Scale
1. Live Deployment:
   - Go live with small positions for initial validation.
   - Monitor logs closely for performance and anomalies.

2. Iterate:
   - Refine strategy and execution logic based on live results.
   - Add AI-driven enhancements (e.g., predictive analytics, sentiment analysis).

3. Scale Up:
   - Gradually increase position sizes and expand to additional asset classes.
   - Introduce portfolio-level risk management and diversification.

---

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Finalize and test the Pine Script strategy.
2. Enhance webhook parsing and execution logic in the Python app.
3. Sync logs for debugging during integration testing.
