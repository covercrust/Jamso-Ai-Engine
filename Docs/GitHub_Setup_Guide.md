# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions to create a GitHub repository for the Jamso AI Engine project.

## 1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your email, create a password, and choose a username
3. Follow the verification steps to complete your account creation

## 2. Create a New Repository

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner, then select "New repository"
3. Enter "Jamso-Ai-Engine" as the Repository name
4. Add an optional description: "Jamso AI Engine trading platform"
5. Choose if the repository should be Public or Private
   - Public: Anyone can see the repository but you control who can commit
   - Private: You choose who can see and commit to the repository
6. Click "Create repository"

## 3. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see instructions on the GitHub page. Since you already have a local repository with code, use these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
# Note: This was already done, but leaving here for reference
# git remote add origin https://github.com/covercrust/Jamso-Ai-Engine.git

# Push your existing repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

You'll be prompted for your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled (recommended), you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

## 4. Create a Personal Access Token (if needed)

If you have two-factor authentication enabled:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give your token a name like "Jamso AI Engine"
4. Select the "repo" scope to allow repository access
5. Click "Generate token" and copy your token
6. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub

## 5. Configure Git to Remember Your Credentials

To avoid entering your credentials every time:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Note: This stores your credentials in plain text in your home directory. For better security, consider using credential caching with a timeout:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

## 6. Verify Your Repository

After pushing your code, go to https://github.com/covercrust/Jamso-Ai-Engine to verify that your code has been uploaded successfully.
