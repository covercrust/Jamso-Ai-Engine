Pine Script™ is
TradingView
’
s programming language. It allows traders to create their owntrading tools and run them on our servers. We designed Pine Script™ as a lightweight, yetpowerful, language for developing indicators and strategies that you can then backtest. Mostof TradingView’s built-in indicators are written in Pine Script™, and our thriving community ofPine Script™ programmers has published more than 100,000
Community Scripts
.
Requirements
It’s our explicit goal to keep Pine Script™ accessible and easy to understand for the broadestpossible audience. Pine Script™ is cloud-based and therefore different from client-sideprogramming languages. While we likely won’t develop Pine Script™ into a full-fledgedlanguage, we do constantly improve it and are always happy to consider requests for newfeatures.
Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose limits inorder to share these resources fairly among our users. We strive to set as few limits aspossible, but will of course have to implement as many as needed for the platform to runsmoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional symbols,execution time, memory usage and script size.

Introduction
Welcome to the Pine Script™
v6 User Manual
, which will accompany you in your journey tolearn to program your own trading tools in Pine Script™. Welcome also to the very activecommunity of Pine Script™ programmers on TradingView.
In this page, we present a step-by-step approach that you can follow to gradually becomemore familiar with indicators and strategies (also called
scripts
) written in the Pine Script™programming language on
TradingView
. We will get you started on your journey to:1.
Use
some of the tens of thousands of existing scripts on the platform.2.
Read
the Pine Script™ code of existing scripts.3.
Write
Pine Script™ scripts.
If you are already familiar with the use of Pine scripts on TradingView and are now ready tolearn how to write your own, then jump to the
Writing scripts
section of this page.
If you are new to our platform, then please read on!
Using
scripts
If you are interested in using technical indicators or strategies on TradingView, you can firststart exploring the thousands of indicators already available on our platform. You can accessexisting indicators on the platform in two different ways:
By using the chart’s “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” button, or
By browsing TradingView’s
Community Scripts
, the largest repository of trading scriptsin the world, with more than 100,000 scripts, most of which are free and open-source,which means you can see their Pine Script™ code.
If you can find the tools you need already written for you, it can be a good way to get startedand gradually become proficient as a script user, until you are ready to start yourprogramming journey in Pine Script™.
Loading scripts from the
chart
To explore and load scripts from your chart, use the “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” button:
The dialog box presents different categories of scripts in its left pane:
Favorites
lists the scripts you have “favorited” by clicking on the star that appears tothe left of its name when you mouse over it.
Personal
displays the scipts you have written and saved in the Pine Editor. They aresaved in TradingView’s cloud.
Technicals
groups most TradingView built-ins organized in four categories: indicators,strategies, profiles, and patterns. Most are written in Pine Script™ and available for free.
Financials
contains all built-in indicators that display financial metrics. The contents ofthat tab and the subcategories they are grouped into depend on the symbol currentlyopen on the chart.
Community
is where you can search from the 100,000+ published scripts written byTradingView users. The scripts can be sorted by one of the three different filters —Editor’s Picks only shows open-source scripts hand-picked my our script moderatots,Top shows the most popular scripts of all time, and Trending displays the most-popularscripts that were published recently.
Invite-only
contains the list of the invite-only scripts you have been granted access toby their authors.
Here, the section containing the TradingView built-ins is selected:
When you click on one of the indicators or strategies (the ones marked with a symbol withtwo arrows), it loads on your chart.
Browsing Community
Scripts
From
TradingView’s homepage
, you can bring up the Community Scripts stream from the“Community” menu. Here, we are pointing to the “Editors’ Picks” section, but there are manyother categories you can choose from:
You can also search for scripts using the homepage’s “Search” field, and filter scripts usingdifferent criteria. The Help Center has a page explaining the
different types of scripts
that areavailable.
The scripts stream shows script
widgets
, i.e., placeholders showing a miniature view of eachpublication’s chart and description, and its author. By clicking on it you will open the
script’spage
, where you can see the script on a chart, read the author’s description, like the script,leave comments or read the script’s source code if it was published open-source.
Once you find an interesting script in the Community Scripts, follow the instructions in theHelp Center to
load it on your chart
.
Changing script
settings
Once a script is loaded on the chart, you can double-click on its name or hover over the nameand press the “Settings” button to bring up its “Settings/Inputs” tab:
The “Inputs” tab allows you to change the settings which the script’s author has decided tomake editable. You can configure some of the script’s visuals using the “Style” tab of thesame dialog box, and which timeframes the script should appear on using the “Visibility” tab.
Other settings are available to all scripts from the buttons that appear to the right of its namewhen you mouse over it, and from the “More” menu (the three dots):
Reading
scripts
Reading code written by
good
programmers is the best way to develop your understanding ofthe language. This is as true for Pine Script™ as it is for all other programming languages.Finding good open-source Pine Script™ code is relatively easy. These are reliable sources ofcode written by good programmers on TradingView:
The TradingView built-in indicators
Scripts selected as
Editors’ Picks
Scripts by the
authors the PineCoders account follows
Many scripts by authors with high reputation and open-source publications.
Reading code from
Community Scripts
is easy; if you don’t see a grey or red “lock” icon in theupper-right corner of the script’s widget, this indicates the script is open-source. By openingits script page, you will be able to see its source.
To see the code of TradingView built-ins, load the indicator on your chart, then hover over itsname and select the “Source code” curly braces icon (if you don’t see it, it’s because theindicator’s source is unavailable). When you click on the icon, the Pine Editor will open andfrom there, you can see the script’s code. If you want to play with it, you will need to press the“create a working copy” button. You will then be able to modify and save the code. Becauseyou will have created a different version of the script, you will need to use the Editor’s “Add toChart” button to add that new copy to the chart.
This shows the Pine Editor having just opened after we selected the “View source” buttonfrom the indicator on our chart. We are about to create a working copy of its source becauseit is read-only for now, as indicated by the orange warning text:
You can also open TradingView built-in indicators from the Pine Editor (accessible from the“Pine Editor” tab at the bottom of the chart) by using the “Open” -> “Built-in script…” menuselection.
Writing
scripts
We have built Pine Script™ to empower both budding and seasoned traders to create theirown trading tools. We have designed it so it is relatively easy to learn for first-timeprogrammers — although learning a first programming language, like trading, is rarely
very
easy for anyone — yet powerful enough for knowledgeable programmers to build tools ofmoderate complexity.
Pine Script™ allows you to write three types of scripts:
Indicators
like RSI, MACD, etc.
Strategies
which include logic to issue trading orders and can be backtested andforward-tested.
Libraries
which are used by more advanced programmers to package oft-usedfunctions that can be reused by other scripts.
The next step we recommend is to write your
first indicator
.

The Pine Editor
The Pine Editor is where you will be working on your scripts. While you can use any text editor
you want to write your Pine scripts, using our Editor has many advantages:
It highlights your code following Pine Script™ syntax.
It pops up syntax reminders when you hover over language constructs.
It provides quick access to the Pine Script™ Reference Manual popup when you ctrl /
cmd + click on built-in Pine Script™ constructs, and opens the library publication
page when doing the same with construsts imported from libraries.
It provides an auto-complete feature that you can activate with ctrl + space or cmd
+ I , depending on your OS.
It makes the write/compile/run cycle fast because saving a new version of a script
loaded on the chart also executes it immediately.
To open the Editor, click on the “Pine Editor” tab at the bottom of your TradingView chart.
This will open up the Editor’s pane.
First version
We will now create our first working Pine script, an implementation of the MACD indicator in
Pine Script™:
Start by bringing up the “Open” dropdown menu at the top right of the Editor and
choose “New indicator”.
Copy the example script above. The button on the top-right of the code widget allows
you to do it with a single click.
Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the example script.
Click “Save” and choose a name for your script. Your script is now saved in
TradingView’s cloud, but under your account’s name. Nobody but you can use it.
Click “Add to Chart” in the Editor’s menu bar. The MACD indicator appears in a separate
pane under your chart.
Your first Pine script is running on your chart, which should look like this:
Let’s look at our script’s code, line by line:
Line 1: //@version=6
This is a compiler annotation telling the compiler the script will use version 6 of Pine
Script™.
Line 2: indicator("MACD #1")
Defines the name of the script that will appear on the chart as “MACD”.
Line 3: fast = 12
Defines a fast integer variable which will be the length of the fast EMA.
Line 4: slow = 26
Defines a slow integer variable which will be the length of the slow EMA.
Line 5: fastMA = ta.ema(close, fast)
Defines the variable fastMA , containing the result of the EMA calculation (Exponential
Moving Average) with a length equal to fast (12), on the close series, i.e., the closing
price of bars.
Line 6: slowMA = ta.ema(close, slow)
Defines the variable slowMA , containing the result of the EMA calculation with a length
equal to slow (26), from close .
Line 7: macd = fastMA - slowMA
Defines the variable macd as the difference between the two EMAs.
Line 8: signal = ta.ema(macd, 9)
Defines the variable signal as a smoothed value of macd using the EMA algorithm
(Exponential Moving Average) with a length of 9.
Line 9: plot(macd, color = color.blue)
Calls the plot function to output the variable macd using a blue line.
Line 10: plot(signal, color = color.orange)
Calls the plot function to output the variable signal using an orange line.
Second version
The first version of our script calculated MACD “manually”, but because Pine Script™ is
designed to write indicators and strategies, built-in Pine Script™ functions exist for many
common indicators, including one for MACD: ta.macd().
This is the second version of our script:
Note that we have:
Added inputs so we can change the lengths for the MAs
We now use the ta.macd() built-in to calculate our MACD, which saves us three line and
makes our code easier to read.
Let’s repeat the same process as before to copy that code in a new indicator:
Start by bringing up the “Open” dropdown menu at the top right of the Editor and
choose “New indicator”.
Then copy the example script above.
Select all the code already in the editor and replace it with the second version of our
script.
Click “Save” and choose a name for your script different than the previous one.
Click “Add to Chart” in the Editor’s menu bar. The “MACD #2” indicator appears in a
separate pane under the “MACD #1” indicator.
Your second Pine script is running on your chart. If you double-click on the indicator’s name
on your chart, you will bring up the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab, where you can now change
the slow and fast lengths:
Let’s look at the lines that have changed in the second version of our script:
Line 2: indicator("MACD #2")
We have changed #1 to #2 so the second version of our indicator displays a different
name on the chart.
Line 3: fastInput = input(12, "Fast length")
Instead of assigning a constant value to a variable, we have used the input() function so we
can change the value in our script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. 12 will be the default value and
the field’s label will be "Fast length" . If the value is changed in the “Inputs” tab, the
fastInput variable’s content will contain the new value and the script will re-execute on
the chart with that new value. Note that, as our Pine Script™ Style Guide recommends, we
add Input to the end of the variable’s name to remind us, later in the script, that its value
comes from a user input.
Line 4: slowInput = input(26, "Slow length")
We do the same for the slow length, taking care to use a different variable name, default
value and text string for the field’s label.
Line 5: [macdLine, signalLine, histLine] = ta.macd(close, fastInput, slowInput, 9)
This is where we call the ta.macd() built-in to perform all the first version’s calculations in
one line only. The function requires four parameters (the values after the function name,
enclosed in parentheses). It returns three values into the three variables instead of only
one, like the functions we used until now, which is why we need to enclose the list of three
variables receiving the function’s result in square brackets, to the left of the = sign. Note
that two of the values we pass to the function are the “input” variables containing the fast
and slow lengths: fastInput and slowInput .
Line 6 and 7:
The variable names we are plotting there have changed, but the lines are doing the same
thing as in our first version.
Our second version performs the same calculations as our first, but we can change the two
lengths used to calculate it. Our code is also simpler and shorter by three lines. We have
improved our script.

After your
first steps
and your
first indicator
, let us explore a bit more of the Pine Script™landscape by sharing some pointers to guide you in your journey to learn Pine Script™.
“indicators” vs
“strategies”
Pine Script™
strategies
are used to backtest on historical data and forward test on openmarkets. In addition to indicator calculations, they contain
strategy.*()
calls to send tradeorders to Pine Script™‘s broker emulator, which can then simulate their execution. Strategiesdisplay backtest results in the “Strategy Tester” tab at the bottom of the chart, next to the“Pine Editor” tab.
Pine Script™ indicators also contain calculations, but cannot be used in backtesting. Becausethey do not require the broker emulator, they use less resources and will run faster. It is thusadvantageous to use indicators whenever you can.
Both indicators and strategies can run in either overlay mode (over the chart’s bars) or panemode (in a separate section below or above the chart). Both can also plot information in theirrespective space, and both can generate
alert events
.
How scripts are
executed
A Pine script is
not
like programs in many programming languages that execute once andthen stop. In the Pine Script™
runtime
environment, a script runs in the equivalent of aninvisible loop where it is executed once on each bar of whatever chart you are on, from left toright. Chart bars that have already closed when the script executes on them are called
historical bars
. When execution reaches the chart’s last bar and the market is open, it is onthe
realtime bar
. The script then executes once every time a price or volume change isdetected, and one last time for that realtime bar when it closes. That realtime bar thenbecomes an
elapsed realtime bar
. Note that when the script executes in realtime, it does notrecalculate on all the chart’s historical bars on every price/volume update. It has alreadycalculated once on those bars, so it does not need to recalculate them on every chart tick.See the
Execution model
page for more information.
When a script executes on a historical bar, the
close
built-in variable holds the value of thatbar’s close. When a script executes on the realtime bar,
close
returns the
current
price of thesymbol until the bar closes.
Contrary to indicators, strategies normally execute only once on realtime bars, when theyclose. They can also be configured to execute on each price/volume update if that is what youneed. See the page on
Strategies
for more information, and to understand how strategiescalculate differently than indicators.
Time
series
The main data structure used in Pine Script™ is called a
time series
. Time series contain onevalue for each bar the script executes on, so they continuously expand as the script executeson more bars. Past values of the time series can be referenced using the history-referencingoperator:
[]
.
close[1]
, for example, refers to the value of
close
on the bar preceding the onewhere the script is executing.
While this indexing mechanism may remind many programmers of arrays, a time series isdifferent and thinking in terms of arrays will be detrimental to understanding this key PineScript™ concept. A good comprehension of both the
execution model
and
time series
isessential in understanding how Pine scripts work. If you have never worked with dataorganized in time series before, you will need practice to put them to work for you. Once youfamiliarize yourself with these key concepts, you will discover that by combining the use oftime series with our built-in functions specifically designed to handle them efficiently, muchcan be accomplished in very few lines of code.
Publishing
scripts
TradingView is home to a large community of Pine Script™ programmers and millions oftraders from all around the world. Once you become proficient enough in Pine Script™, youcan choose to share your scripts with other traders. Before doing so, please take the time tolearn Pine Script™ well-enough to supply traders with an original and reliable tool. All publiclypublished scripts are analyzed by our team of moderators and must comply with our
ScriptPublishing Rules
, which require them to be original and well-documented.
If want to use Pine scripts for your own use, simply write them in the Pine Editor and add themto your chart from there; you don’t have to publish them to use them. If you want to shareyour scripts with just a few friends, you can publish them privately and send your friends thebrowser’s link to your private publication. See the page on
Publishing
for more information.
Getting around the Pine Script™

User Manual / Language / Execution model
Execution model
The execution model of the Pine Script™ runtime is intimately linked to Pine Script™‘s time
series and type system. Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of
Pine Script™.
The execution model determines how your script is executed on charts, and thus how the
code you write in scripts works. Your code would do nothing were it not for Pine Script™‘s
runtime, which kicks in after your code has compiled and it is executed on your chart because
one of the events triggering the execution of a script has occurred.
When a Pine script is loaded on a chart it executes once on each historical bar using the
available OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) values for each bar. Once the script’s
execution reaches the rightmost bar in the dataset, if trading is currently active on the chart’s
symbol, then Pine Script™ indicators will execute once every time an update occurs, i.e., price
or volume changes. Pine Script™ strategies will by default only execute when the rightmost
bar closes, but they can also be configured to execute on every update, like indicators do.
All symbol/timeframe pairs have a dataset comprising a limited number of bars. When you
scroll a chart to the left to see the dataset’s earlier bars, the corresponding bars are loaded on
the chart. The loading process stops when there are no more bars for that particular
symbol/timeframe pair or the maximum number of bars your account type permits has been
loaded. You can scroll the chart to the left until the very first bar of the dataset, which has an
index value of 0 (see bar_index).
When the script first runs on a chart, all bars in a dataset are historical bars, except the
rightmost one if a trading session is active. When trading is active on the rightmost bar, it is
called the realtime bar. The realtime bar updates when a price or volume change is detected.
When the realtime bar closes, it becomes an elapsed realtime bar and a new realtime bar
opens.
Calculation based on historical bars
Let’s take a simple script and follow its execution on historical bars:
On historical bars, a script executes at the equivalent of the bar’s close, when the OHLCV
values are all known for that bar. Prior to execution of the script on a bar, the built-in variables
such as open , high , low , close , volume and time are set to values corresponding to
those from that bar. A script executes once per historical bar.
Our example script is first executed on the very first bar of the dataset at index 0. Each
statement is executed using the values for the current bar. Accordingly, on the first bar of the
dataset, the following statement:
initializes the variable src with the close value for that first bar, and each of the next lines
is executed in turn. Because the script only executes once for each historical bar, the script
will always calculate using the same close value for a specific historical bar.
The execution of each line in the script produces calculations which in turn generate the
indicator’s output values, which can then be plotted on the chart. Our example uses the plot
and plotshape calls at the end of the script to output some values. In the case of a strategy,
the outcome of the calculations can be used to plot values or dictate the orders to be placed.
After execution and plotting on the first bar, the script is executed on the dataset’s second
bar, which has an index of 1. The process then repeats until all historical bars in the dataset
are processed and the script reaches the rightmost bar on the chart.
Calculation based on realtime bars
The behavior of a Pine script on the realtime bar is very different than on historical bars.
Recall that the realtime bar is the rightmost bar on the chart when trading is active on the
chart’s symbol. Also, recall that strategies can behave in two different ways in the realtime
bar. By default, they only execute when the realtime bar closes, but the calc_on_every_tick
parameter of the strategy declaration statement can be set to true to modify the strategy’s
behavior so that it executes each time the realtime bar updates, as indicators do. The
behavior described here for indicators will thus only apply to strategies using
calc_on_every_tick=true .
The most important difference between execution of scripts on historical and realtime bars is
that while they execute only once on historical bars, scripts execute every time an update
occurs during a realtime bar. This entails that built-in variables such as high , low and
close which never change on a historical bar, can change at each of a script’s iteration in
the realtime bar. Changes in the built-in variables used in the script’s calculations will, in turn,
induce changes in the results of those calculations. This is required for the script to follow the
realtime price action. As a result, the same script may produce different results every time it
executes during the realtime bar.
Note: In the realtime bar, the close variable always represents the current price. Similarly,
the high and low built-in variables represent the highest high and lowest low reached since
the realtime bar’s beginning. Pine Script™‘s built-in variables will only represent the realtime
bar’s final values on the bar’s last update.
Let’s follow our script example in the realtime bar.
When the script arrives on the realtime bar it executes a first time. It uses the current values
of the built-in variables to produce a set of results and plots them if required. Before the script
executes another time when the next update happens, its user-defined variables are reset to a
known state corresponding to that of the last commit at the close of the previous bar. If no
commit was made on the variables because they are initialized every bar, then they are
reinitialized. In both cases their last calculated state is lost. The state of plotted labels and
lines is also reset. This resetting of the script’s user-defined variables and drawings prior to
each new iteration of the script in the realtime bar is called rollback. Its effect is to reset the
script to the same known state it was in when the realtime bar opened, so calculations in the
realtime bar are always performed from a clean state.
The constant recalculation of a script’s values as price or volume changes in the realtime bar
can lead to a situation where variable c in our example becomes true because a cross has
occurred, and so the red marker plotted by the script’s last line would appear on the chart. If
on the next price update the price has moved in such a way that the close value no longer
produces calculations making c true because there is no longer a cross, then the marker
previously plotted will disappear.
When the realtime bar closes, the script executes a last time. As usual, variables are rolled
back prior to execution. However, since this iteration is the last one on the realtime bar,
variables are committed to their final values for the bar when calculations are completed.
To summarize the realtime bar process:
A script executes at the open of the realtime bar and then once per update.
Variables are rolled back before every realtime update.
Variables are committed once at the closing bar update.
Events triggering the execution of a script
A script is executed on the complete set of bars on the chart when one of the following events
occurs:
A new symbol or timeframe is loaded on a chart.
A script is saved or added to the chart, from the Pine Script™ Editor or the chart’s
“Indicators & strategies” dialog box.
A value is modified in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” dialog box.
A value is modified in a strategy’s “Settings/Properties” dialog box.
A browser refresh event is detected.
A script is executed on the realtime bar when trading is active and:
One of the above conditions occurs, causing the script to execute on the open of the
realtime bar, or
The realtime bar updates because a price or volume change was detected.
Note that when a chart is left untouched when the market is active, a succession of realtime
bars which have been opened and then closed will trail the current realtime bar. While these
elapsed realtime bars will have been confirmed because their variables have all been
committed, the script will not yet have executed on them in their historical state, since they
did not exist when the script was last run on the chart’s dataset.
When an event triggers the execution of the script on the chart and causes it to run on those
bars which have now become historical bars, the script’s calculation can sometimes vary from
what they were when calculated on the last closing update of the same bars when they were
realtime bars. This can be caused by slight variations between the OHLCV values saved at the
close of realtime bars and those fetched from data feeds when the same bars have become
historical bars. This behavior is one of the possible causes of repainting.
More information
The built-in barstate.* variables provide information on the type of bar or the event
where the script is executing. The page where they are documented also contains a
script that allows you to visualize the difference between elapsed realtime and historical
bars, for example.
The Strategies page explains the details of strategy calculations, which are not identical
to those of indicators.
Historical values of functions
Every function call in Pine leaves a trail of historical values that a script can access on
subsequent bars using the [] operator. The historical series of functions depend on
successive calls to record the output on every bar. When a script does not call functions on
each bar, it can produce an inconsistent history that may impact calculations and results,
namely when it depends on the continuity of their historical series to operate as expected.
The compiler warns users in these cases to make them aware that the values from a function,
whether built-in or user-defined, might be misleading.
To demonstrate, let’s write a script that calculates the index of the current bar and outputs
that value on every second bar. In the following script, we’ve defined a calcBarIndex()
function that adds 1 to the previous value of its internal index variable on every bar. The
script calls the function on each bar that the condition returns true on (every other bar) to
update the customIndex value. It plots this value alongside the built-in bar_index to validate
the output:
Note that:
The nz() function replaces na values with a specified replacement value (0 by default).
On the first bar of the script, when the index series has no history, the na value is
replaced with -1 before adding 1 to return an initial value of 0.
Upon inspecting the chart, we see that the two plots differ wildly. The reason for this behavior
is that the script called calcBarIndex() within the scope of an if structure on every other bar,
resulting in a historical output inconsistent with the bar_index series. When calling the
function once every two bars, internally referencing the previous value of index gets the
value from two bars ago, i.e., the last bar the function executed on. This behavior results in a
customIndex value of half that of the built-in bar_index .
To align the calcBarIndex() output with the bar_index , we can move the function call to the
script’s global scope. That way, the function will execute on every bar, allowing its entire
history to be recorded and referenced rather than only the results from every other bar. In the
code below, we’ve defined a globalScopeBarIndex variable in the global scope and assigned
it to the return from calcBarIndex() rather than calling the function locally. The script sets
the customIndex to the value of globalScopeBarIndex on the occurrence of the condition :
This behavior can also radically impact built-in functions that reference history internally. For
example, the ta.sma() function references its past values “under the hood”. If a script calls this
function conditionally rather than on every bar, the values within the calculation can change
significantly. We can ensure calculation consistency by assigning ta.sma() to a variable in the
global scope and referencing that variable’s history as needed.
The following example calculates three SMA series: controlSMA , localSMA , and globalSMA .
The script calculates controlSMA in the global scope and localSMA within the local scope of
an if structure. Within the if structure, it also updates the value of globalSMA using the
controlSMA value. As we can see, the values from the globalSMA and controlSMA series
align, whereas the localSMA series diverges from the other two because it uses an
incomplete history, which affects its calculations:
Why this behavior?
This behavior is required because forcing the execution of functions on each bar would lead
to unexpected results in those functions that produce side effects, i.e., the ones that do
something aside from returning the value. For example, the label.new() function creates a
label on the chart, so forcing it to be called on every bar even when it is inside of an if
structure would create labels where they should not logically appear.
Exceptions
Not all built-in functions use their previous values in their calculations, meaning not all require
execution on every bar. For example, math.max() compares all arguments passed into it to
return the highest value. Such functions that do not interact with their history in any way do
not require special treatment.
If the usage of a function within a conditional block does not cause a compiler warning, it’s
safe to use without impacting calculations. Otherwise, move the function call to the global
scope to force consistent execution. When keeping a function call within a conditional block
despite the warning, ensure the output is correct at the very least to avoid unexpected
results.

Time series
Time
series
Much of the power of Pine Script™ stems from the fact that it is designed to process
timeseries
efficiently. Time series are not a qualified type; they are the fundamental structure PineScript™ uses to store the successive values of a variable over time, where each value istethered to a point in time. Since charts are composed of bars, each representing a particularpoint in time, time series are the ideal data structure to work with values that may change withtime.
The notion of time series is intimately linked to Pine Script™‘s
execution model
and
typesystem
concepts. Understanding all three is key to making the most of the power of PineScript™.
Take the built-in
open
variable, which contains the “open” price of each bar in the dataset, the
dataset
being all the bars on any given chart. If your script is running on a 5min chart, theneach value in the
open
time series is the “open” price of the consecutive 5min chart bars.When your script refers to
open
, it is referring to the “open” price of the bar the script isexecuting on. To refer to past values in a time series, we use the
[]
history-referencingoperator. When a script is executing on a given bar,
open[1]
refers to the value of the
open
time series on the previous bar.
While time series may remind programmers of arrays, they are totally different. Pine Script™does use an array data structure, but it is a completely different concept than a time series.
Time series in Pine Script™, combined with its special type of runtime engine and built-infunctions, are what makes it easy to compute the cumulative total of
close
values withoutusing a
for
loop, with only
ta.cum(close)
. This is possible because although
ta.cum(close)
appears rather static in a script, it is in fact executed on each bar, so its value becomesincreasingly larger as the
close
value of each new bar is added to it. When the script reachesthe rightmost bar of the chart,
ta.cum(close)
returns the sum of the
close
value from all barson the chart.
Similarly, the mean of the difference between the last 14
high
and
low
values can beexpressed as
ta.sma(high - low, 14)
, or the distance in bars since the last time the chartmade five consecutive higher highs as
barssince(rising(high, 5))
.
Even the result of function calls on successive bars leaves a trace of values in a time seriesthat can be referenced using the
[]
history-referencing operator. This can be useful, forexample, when testing the
close
of the current bar for a breach of the highest
high
in the last10 bars, but excluding the current bar, which we could write as
breach = close >highest(close, 10)[1]
. The same statement could also be written as
breach = close >highest(close[1], 10)
.
The same looping logic on all bars is applied to function calls such as
plot(open)
which willrepeat on each bar, successively plotting on the chart the value of
open
for each bar.
Do not confuse “time series” with the “series” qualifier. The
time series
concept explains howconsecutive values of variables are stored in Pine Script™; the “series” qualifier denotesvariables whose values can change bar to bar. Consider, for example, the
timeframe.period
built-in variable which has the “simple” qualifier and “string” type, meaning it is of the “simplestring” qualified type. The “simple” qualifier entails that the variable’s value is established onbar zero (the first bar where the script executes) and will not change during the script’sexecution on any of the chart’s bars. The variable’s value is the chart’s timeframe in stringformat, so
"D"
for a 1D chart, for example. Even though its value cannot change during thescript, it would be syntactically correct in Pine Script™ (though not very useful) to refer to itsvalue 10 bars ago using
timeframe.period[10]
. This is possible because the successivevalues of
timeframe.period
for each bar are stored in a time series, even though all the valuesin that particular time series are the same. Note, however, that when the
[]
operator is used toaccess past values of a variable, it yields a “series” qualified value, even when the variablewithout an offset uses a different qualifier, such as “simple” in the case of
timeframe.period
.
When you grasp how time series can be efficiently handled using Pine Script™‘s syntax andits
execution model
, you can define complex calculations using little code.

Script structure
User Manual / Language / Script structure
Script structure
A Pine script follows this general structure:
Version
A compiler annotation in the following form tells the compiler which of the versions of Pine
Script™ the script is written in:
The version number is a number from 1 to 6.
The compiler annotation is not mandatory. When omitted, version 1 is assumed. It is
strongly recommended to always use the latest version of the language.
While it is synctactically correct to place the version compiler annotation anywhere in
the script, it is much more useful to readers when it appears at the top of the script.
Notable changes to the current version of Pine Script™ are documented in the Release notes.
Declaration statement
All Pine scripts must contain one declaration statement, which is a call to one of these
functions:
indicator()
strategy()
library()
The declaration statement:
Identifies the type of the script, which in turn dictates which content is allowed in it, and
how it can be used and executed.
Sets key properties of the script such as its name, where it will appear when it is added
to a chart, the precision and format of the values it displays, and certain values that
govern its runtime behavior, such as the maximum number of drawing objects it will
display on the chart. With strategies, the properties include parameters that control
backtesting, such as initial capital, commission, slippage, etc.
Each type of script has distinct requirements:
Indicators must contain at least one function call which produces output on the chart
(e.g., plot(), plotshape(), barcolor(), line.new(), etc.).
Strategies must contain at least one strategy.*() call, e.g., strategy.entry().
Libraries must contain at least one exported function or user-defined type.
Code
Lines in a script that are not comments or compiler annotations are statements, which
implement the script’s algorithm. A statement can be one of these:
variable declaration
variable reassignement
function declaration
built-in function call, user-defined function call or a library function call
if, for, while, switch, type, or enumstructure.
Statements can be arranged in multiple ways:
Some statements can be expressed in one line, like most variable declarations, lines
containing only a function call or single-line function declarations. Lines can also be
wrapped (continued on multiple lines). Multiple one-line statements can be
concatenated on a single line by using the comma as a separator.
Others statements such as structures or multi-line function declarations always require
multiple lines because they require a local block. A local block must be indented by a tab
or four spaces. Each local block defines a distinct local scope.
Statements in the global scope of the script (i.e., which are not part of local blocks)
cannot begin with white space (a space or a tab). Their first character must also be the
line’s first character. Lines beginning in a line’s first position become by definition part of
the script’s global scope.
A simple valid Pine Script™ indicator can be generated in the Pine Script™ Editor by using the
“Open” button and choosing “New blank indicator”:
This indicator includes three local blocks, one in the barIsUp() function declaration, and two
in the variable declaration using an if structure:
You can bring up a simple Pine Script™ strategy by selecting “New blank strategy” instead:
Comments
Double slashes ( // ) define comments in Pine Script™. Comments can begin anywhere on
the line. They can also follow Pine Script™ code on the same line:
The Pine Editor has a keyboard shortcut to comment/uncomment lines: ctrl + / . You can
use it on multiple lines by highlighting them first.
Line wrapping
Long lines can be split on multiple lines, or “wrapped”. Wrapped lines must be indented with
any number of spaces, provided it’s not a multiple of four (those boundaries are used to
indent local blocks):
may be wrapped as:
A long plot() call may be wrapped as:
Statements inside user-defined function declarations can also be wrapped. However, since a
local block must syntactically begin with an indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab), when splitting it
onto the following line, the continuation of the statement must start with more than one
indentation (not equal to a multiple of four spaces). For example:
You can use comments in wrapped lines:
Compiler annotations
Compiler annotations are comments that issue special instructions for a script:
//@version= specifies the PineScript™ version that the compiler will use. The number
in this annotation should not be confused with the script’s version number, which
updates on every saved change to the code.
//@description sets a custom description for scripts that use the library() declaration
statement.
//@function , //@param and //@returns add custom descriptions for a user-defined
function or method, its parameters, and its result when placed above the function
declaration.
//@type adds a custom description for a user-defined type (UDT) when placed above
the type declaration.
//@enum adds a custom description for an enum types when placed above the enum
declaration.
//@field adds a custom description for the field of a user-defined type (UDT) or an
enum types when placed above the type or enum declaration.
//@variable adds a custom description for a variable when placed above its
declaration.
//@strategy_alert_message provides a default message for strategy scripts to pre-fill
the “Message” field in the alert creation dialog.
The Pine Editor also features two specialized annotations, //#region and //#endregion ,
that create collapsible code regions. Clicking the dropdown arrow next to a //#region line
collapses all the code between that line and the nearest //#endregion annotation below it.
This example draws a triangle using three interactively selected points on the chart. The
script illustrates how one can use compiler and Editor annotations to document code and
make it easier to navigate:

Operators
Introduction
Some operators are used to build expressions returning a result:
Arithmetic operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
The ?: ternary operator
The [] history-referencing operator
Other operators are used to assign values to variables:
= is used to assign a value to a variable, but only when you declare the variable (the
first time you use it)
:= is used to assign a value to a previously declared variable. The following
operators can also be used in such a way: += , -= , *= , /= , %=
As is explained in the Type system page, qualifiers and types play a critical role in determining
the type of results that expressions yield. This, in turn, has an impact on how and with what
functions you will be allowed to use those results. Expressions always return a value with the
strongest qualifier used in the expression, e.g., if you multiply an “input int” with a “series int”,
the expression will produce a “series int” result, which you will not be able to use as the
argument to length in ta.ema().
This script will produce a compilation error:
The compiler will complain: Cannot call ‘ta.ema’ with argument ‘length’=‘adjustedLength’. An
argument of ‘series int’ type was used but a ‘simple int’ is expected;. This is happening
because lenInput is an “input int” but factor is a “series int” (it can only be determined by
looking at the value of year on each bar). The adjustedLength variable is thus assigned a
“series int” value. Our problem is that the Reference Manual entry for ta.ema() tells us that its
length parameter requires a “simple” value, which is a weaker qualifier than “series”, so a
“series int” value is not allowed.
The solution to our conundrum requires:
Using another moving average function that supports a “series int” length, such as
ta.sma(), or
Not using a calculation producing a “series int” value for our length.
Arithmetic operators
There are five arithmetic operators in Pine Script™:
Operator Meaning
+ Addition and string concatenation
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (remainder after division)
The arithmetic operators above are all binary (means they need two operands — or values —
to work on, like in 1 + 2 ). The + and - also serve as unary operators (means they work on
one operand, like -1 or +1 ).
If both operands are numbers but at least one of these is of float type, the result will also be a
float. If both operands are of int type, the result will also be an int. If at least one operand is
na, the result is also na.
The + operator also serves as the concatenation operator for strings. "EUR"+"USD" yields
the "EURUSD" string.
The % operator calculates the modulo by rounding down the quotient to the lowest possible
value. Here is an easy example that helps illustrate how the modulo is calculated behind the
scenes:
Comparison operators
There are six comparison operators in Pine Script™:
Operator Meaning
< Less Than
<= Less Than or Equal To
!= Not Equal
== Equal
> Greater Than
>= Greater Than or Equal To
Comparison operations are binary. If both operands have a numerical value, the result will be
of type bool, i.e., true , false or na.
Examples:
Logical operators
There are three logical operators in Pine Script™:
Operator Meaning
not Negation
and Logical Conjunction
or Logical Disjunction
The operator not is unary. When applied to a true , operand the result will be false , and
vice versa.
and operator truth table:
a b a and b
true true true
true false false
false true false
false false false
or operator truth table:
a b a or b
true true true
true false true
false true true
false false false
`?:` ternary operator
The ?: ternary operator is used to create expressions of the form:
The ternary operator returns a result that depends on the value of condition . If it is true ,
then valueWhenConditionIsTrue is returned. If condition is false or na, then
valueWhenConditionIsFalse is returned.
A combination of ternary expressions can be used to achieve the same effect as a switch
structure, e.g.:
The example is calculated from left to right:
If timeframe.isintraday is true , then color.red is returned. If it is false , then
timeframe.isdaily is evaluated.
If timeframe.isdaily is true , then color.green is returned. If it is false , then
timeframe.ismonthly is evaluated.
If timeframe.ismonthly is true , then color.blue is returned, otherwise na is returned.
Note that the return values on each side of the : are expressions --- not local blocks, so
they will not affect the limit of 500 local blocks per scope.
`[ ]` history-referencing operator
It is possible to refer to past values of time series using the [] history-referencing operator.
Past values are values a variable had on bars preceding the bar where the script is currently
executing — the current bar. See the Execution model page for more information about the
way scripts are executed on bars.
The [] operator is used after a variable, expression or function call. The value used inside the
square brackets of the operator is the offset in the past we want to refer to. To refer to the
value of the volume built-in variable two bars away from the current bar, one would use
volume[2] .
Because series grow dynamically, as the script moves on sucessive bars, the offset used with
the operator will refer to different bars. Let’s see how the value returned by the same offset is
dynamic, and why series are very different from arrays. In Pine Script™, the close variable, or
close[0] which is equivalent, holds the value of the current bar’s “close”. If your code is now
executing on the third bar of the dataset (the set of all bars on your chart), close will
contain the price at the close of that bar, close[1] will contain the price at the close of the
preceding bar (the dataset’s second bar), and close[2] , the first bar. close[3] will return
na because no bar exists in that position, and thus its value is not available.
When the same code is executed on the next bar, the fourth in the dataset, close will now
contain the closing price of that bar, and the same close[1] used in your code will now refer
to the “close” of the third bar in the dataset. The close of the first bar in the dataset will now
be close[3] , and this time close[4] will return na.
In the Pine Script™ runtime environment, as your code is executed once for each historical bar
in the dataset, starting from the left of the chart, Pine Script™ is adding a new element in the
series at index 0 and pushing the pre-existing elements in the series one index further away.
Arrays, in comparison, can have constant or variable sizes, and their content or indexing
structure is not modified by the runtime environment. Pine Script™ series are thus very
different from arrays and only share familiarity with them through their indexing syntax.
When the market for the chart’s symbol is open and the script is executing on the chart’s last
bar, the realtime bar, close returns the value of the current price. It will only contain the actual
closing price of the realtime bar the last time the script is executed on that bar, when it closes.
Pine Script™ has a variable that contains the number of the bar the script is executing on:
bar_index. On the first bar, bar_index is equal to 0 and it increases by 1 on each successive
bar the script executes on. On the last bar, bar_index is equal to the number of bars in the
dataset minus one.
There is another important consideration to keep in mind when using the [] operator in Pine
Script™. We have seen cases when a history reference may return the na value. na represents
a value which is not a number and using it in any expression will produce a result that is also
na (similar to NaN). Such cases often happen during the script’s calculations in the early bars
of the dataset, but can also occur in later bars under certain conditions. If your code does not
explicitly provide for handling these special cases, they can introduce invalid results in your
script’s calculations which can ripple through all the way to the realtime bar. The na and nz
functions are designed to allow for handling such cases.
These are all valid uses of the [] operator:
Note that the [] operator can only be used once on the same value. This is not allowed:
Operator precedence
The order of calculations is determined by the operators’ precedence. Operators with greater
precedence are calculated first. Below is a list of operators sorted by decreasing precedence:
Precedence Operator
9 []
8 unary + , unary - , not
7 * , / , %
6 + , -
5 > , < , >= , <=
4 == , !=
3 and
2 or
1 ?:
If in one expression there are several operators with the same precedence, then they are
calculated left to right.
If the expression must be calculated in a different order than precedence would dictate, then
parts of the expression can be grouped together with parentheses.
`=` assignement operator
The = operator is used to assign a variable when it is initialized --- or declared ---, i.e., the
first time you use it. It says this is a new variable that I will be using, and I want it to start on
each bar with this value.
These are all valid variable declarations:
See the Variable declarations page for more information on how to declare variables.
`:=` reassignement operator
The := is used to reassign a value to an existing variable. It says use this variable that was
declared earlier in my script, and give it a new value.
Variables which have been first declared, then reassigned using := , are called mutable
variables. All the following examples are valid variable reassignments. You will find more
information on how var works in the section on the `var` declaration mode:
Note that:
We declare pHi with this code: var float pHi = na . The var keyword tells Pine
Script™ that we only want that variable initialized with na on the dataset’s first bar. The
float keyword tells the compiler we are declaring a variable of type “float”. This is
necessary because, contrary to most cases, the compiler cannot automatically
determine the type of the value on the right side of the = sign.
While the variable declaration will only be executed on the first bar because it uses var,
the pHi := nz(ta.pivothigh(5, 5), pHi) line will be executed on all the chart’s bars.
On each bar, it evaluates if the pivothigh() call returns na because that is what the
function does when it hasn’t found a new pivot. The nz() function is the one doing the
“checking for na” part. When its first argument ( ta.pivothigh(5, 5) ) is na, it returns
the second argument ( pHi ) instead of the first. When pivothigh() returns the price
point of a newly found pivot, that value is assigned to pHi . When it returns na because
no new pivot was found, we assign the previous value of pHi to itself, in effect
preserving its previous value.
The output of our script looks like this:
Note that:
The line preserves its previous value until a new pivot is found.
Pivots are detected five bars after the pivot actually occurs because our
ta.pivothigh(5, 5) call says that we require five lower highs on both sides of a high
point for it to be detected as a pivot.
See the Variable reassignment section for more information on how to reassign values to
variables.

Variable declarations
Introduction
Variables are identifiers that hold values. They must be declared in your code before you use
them. The syntax of variable declarations is:
or
where:
| means “or”, and parts enclosed in square brackets ( [] ) can appear zero or one
time.
<declaration_mode> is the variable’s declaration mode. It can be var or varip, or nothing.
<type> is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see types).
<identifier> is the variable’s name.
<expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
<structure> can be an if, for, while or switch structure.
<tuple_declaration> is a comma-separated list of variable names enclosed in square
brackets ( [] ), e.g., [ma, upperBand, lowerBand] .
These are all valid variable declarations. The last one requires four lines:
The formal syntax of a variable declaration is:
Initialization with `na`
In most cases, an explicit type declaration is redundant because type is automatically inferred
from the value on the right of the = at compile time, so the decision to use them is often a
matter of preference. For example:
In the first line of the example, the compiler cannot determine the type of the baseLine0
variable because na is a generic value of no particular type. The declaration of the baseLine1
variable is correct because its float type is declared explicitly. The declaration of the
baseLine2 variable is also correct because its type can be derived from the expression
float(na) , which is an explicit cast of the na value to the float type. The declarations of
baseLine1 and baseLine2 are equivalent.
Tuple declarations
Function calls or structures are allowed to return multiple values. When we call them and want
to store the values they return, a tuple declaration must be used, which is a commaseparated
set of one or more values enclosed in brackets. This allows us to declare multiple
variables simultaneously. As an example, the ta.bb() built-in function for Bollinger bands
returns three values:
Using an underscore ( _ ) as an identifier
When declaring a variable, it is possible to use a single underscore ( _ ) as its identifier. A
value assigned to such a variable cannot be accessed. You can assign any number of values
to a _ identifier anywhere in the script, even if the current scope already has such an
assignment.
This is particularly useful when a tuple returns unneeded values. Let’s write another Bollinger
Bands script. Here, we only need the bands themselves, without the center line:
Variable reassignment
A variable reassignment is done using the := reassignment operator. It can only be done after
a variable has been first declared and given an initial value. Reassigning a new value to a
variable is often necessary in calculations, and it is always necessary when a variable from the
global scope must be assigned a new value from within a structure’s local block, e.g.:
Note that:
We initialize maColor on the first bar only, so it preserves its value across bars.
On every bar, the if statement checks if the MA has been rising or falling for the userspecified
number of bars (the default is 2). When that happens, the value of maColor
must be reassigned a new value from within the if local blocks. To do this, we use the :=
reassignment operator.
If we did not use the := reassignment operator, the effect would be to initialize a new
maColor local variable which would have the same name as that of the global scope,
but actually be a very confusing independent entity that would persist only for the
length of the local block, and then disappear without a trace.
All user-defined variables in Pine Script™ are mutable, which means their value can be
changed using the := reassignment operator. Assigning a new value to a variable may change
its type qualifier (see the page on Pine Script™‘s type system for more information). A variable
can be assigned a new value as many times as needed during the script’s execution on one
bar, so a script can contain any number of reassignments of one variable. A variable’s
declaration mode determines how new values assigned to a variable will be saved.
Declaration modes
Understanding the impact that declaration modes have on the behavior of variables requires
prior knowledge of Pine Script™‘s execution model.
When you declare a variable, if a declaration mode is specified, it must come first. Three
modes can be used:
“On each bar”, when none is specified
var
varip
On each bar
When no explicit declaration mode is specified, i.e. no var or varip keyword is used, the
variable is declared and initialized on each bar, e.g., the following declarations from our first
set of examples in this page’s introduction:
`var`
When the var keyword is used, the variable is only initialized once, on the first bar if the
declaration is in the global scope, or the first time the local block is executed if the declaration
is inside a local block. After that, it will preserve its last value on successive bars, until we
reassign a new value to it. This behavior is very useful in many cases where a variable’s value
must persist through the iterations of a script across successive bars. For example, suppose
we’d like to count the number of green bars on the chart:
Without the var modifier, variable count would be reset to zero (thus losing its value) every
time a new bar update triggered a script recalculation.
Declaring variables on the first bar only is often useful to manage drawings more efficiently.
Suppose we want to extend the last bar’s close line to the right of the right chart. We could
write:
but this is inefficient because we are creating and deleting the line on each historical bar and
on each update in the realtime bar. It is more efficient to use:
Note that:
We initialize closeLine on the first bar only, using the var declaration mode
We restrict the execution of the rest of our code to the chart’s last bar by enclosing our
code that updates the line in an if barstate.islast structure.
There is a very slight penalty performance for using the var declaration mode. For that reason,
when declaring constants, it is preferable not to use var if performance is a concern, unless
the initialization involves calculations that take longer than the maintenance penalty, e.g.,
functions with complex code or string manipulations.
`varip`
Understanding the behavior of variables using the varip declaration mode requires prior
knowledge of Pine Script™‘s execution model and bar states.
The varip keyword can be used to declare variables that escape the rollback process, which is
explained in the page on Pine Script™‘s execution model.
Whereas scripts only execute once at the close of historical bars, when a script is running in
realtime, it executes every time the chart’s feed detects a price or volume update. At every
realtime update, Pine Script™‘s runtime normally resets the values of a script’s variables to
their last committed value, i.e., the value they held when the previous bar closed. This is
generally handy, as each realtime script execution starts from a known state, which simplifies
script logic.
Sometimes, however, script logic requires code to be able to save variable values between
different executions in the realtime bar. Declaring variables with varip makes that possible.
The “ip” in varip stands for intrabar persist.
Let’s look at the following code, which does not use varip:
On historical bars, barstate.isnew is always true, so the plot shows a value of “1” because the
else part of the if structure is never executed. On realtime bars, barstate.isnew is only true
when the script first executes on the bar’s “open”. The plot will then briefly display “1” until
subsequent executions occur. On the next executions during the realtime bar, the second
branch of the if statement is executed because barstate.isnew is no longer true. Since
updateNo is initialized to na at each execution, the updateNo + 1 expression yields na, so
nothing is plotted on further realtime executions of the script.
If we now use varip to declare the updateNo variable, the script behaves very differently:
The difference now is that updateNo tracks the number of realtime updates that occur on
each realtime bar. This can happen because the varip declaration allows the value of
updateNo to be preserved between realtime updates; it is no longer rolled back at each
realtime execution of the script. The test on barstate.isnew allows us to reset the update
count when a new realtime bar comes in.
Because varip only affects the behavior of your code in the realtime bar, it follows that
backtest results on strategies designed using logic based on varip variables will not be able to
reproduce that behavior on historical bars, which will invalidate test results on them. This also
entails that plots on historical bars will not be able to reproduce the script’s behavior in
realtime.

User Manual / Language / Conditional structures
Conditional structures
Introduction
The conditional structures in Pine Script™ are if and switch. They can be used:
For their side effects, i.e., when they don’t return a value but do things, like reassign
values to variables or call functions.
To return a value or a tuple which can then be assigned to one (or more, in the case of
tuples) variable.
Conditional structures, like the for and while structures, can be embedded; you can use an if
or switch inside another structure.
Some Pine Script™ built-in functions cannot be called from within the local blocks of
conditional structures. They are: alertcondition(), barcolor(), fill(), hline(), indicator(), library(),
plot(), plotbar(), plotcandle(), plotchar(), plotshape(), strategy(). This does not entail their
functionality cannot be controlled by conditions evaluated by your script — only that it cannot
be done by including them in conditional structures. Note that while input*.() function calls
are allowed in local blocks, their functionality is the same as if they were in the script’s global
scope.
The local blocks in conditional structures must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
`if` structure
`if` used for its side effects
An if structure used for its side effects has the following syntax:
where:
Parts enclosed in square brackets ( [] ) can appear zero or one time, and those
enclosed in curly braces ( {} ) can appear zero or more times.
<expression> must be of “bool” type or be auto-castable to that type, which is only
possible for “int” or “float” values (see the Type system page).
<local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can
be a tuple of values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
There can be zero or more else if clauses.
There can be zero or one else clause.
When the <expression> following the if evaluates to true, the first local block is executed, the
if structure’s execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the local block are
returned.
When the <expression> following the if evaluates to false, the successive else if clauses
are evaluated, if there are any. When the <expression> of one evaluates to true, its local block
is executed, the if structure’s execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the
local block are returned.
When no <expression> has evaluated to true and an else clause exists, its local block is
executed, the if structure’s execution ends, and the value(s) evaluated at the end of the local
block are returned.
When no <expression> has evaluated to true and no else clause exists, na is returned. The
only exception to this is if the structure returns “bool” values — in that case, false is returned
instead.
Using if structures for their side effects can be useful to manage the order flow in strategies,
for example. While the same functionality can often be achieved using the when parameter in
strategy.*() calls, code using if structures is easier to read:
Restricting the execution of your code to specific bars ican be done using if structures, as we
do here to restrict updates to our label to the chart’s last bar:
Note that:
We initialize the ourLabel variable on the script’s first bar only, as we use the var
declaration mode. The value used to initialize the variable is provided by the label.new()
function call, which returns a label ID pointing to the label it creates. We use that call to
set the label’s properties because once set, they will persist until we change them.
What happens next is that on each successive bar the Pine Script™ runtime will skip the
initialization of ourLabel , and the if structure’s condition (barstate.islast) is evaluated. It
returns false on all bars until the last one, so the script does nothing on most historical
bars after bar zero.
On the last bar, barstate.islast becomes true and the structure’s local block executes,
modifying on each chart update the properties of our label, which displays the number
of bars in the dataset.
We want to display the label’s text without a background, so we make the label’s
background na in the label.new() function call, and we use hl2[1] for the label’s y
position because we don’t want it to move all the time. By using the average of the
previous bar’s high and low values, the label doesn’t move until the moment when the
next realtime bar opens.
We use bar_index + 2 in our label.set_xy() call to offset the label to the right by two
bars.
`if` used to return a value
An if structure used to return one or more values has the following syntax:
where:
Parts enclosed in square brackets ( [] ) can appear zero or one time, and those
enclosed in curly braces ( {} ) can appear zero or more times.
<declaration_mode> is the variable’s declaration mode
<type> is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see types)
<identifier> is the variable’s name
<expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
<local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can
be a tuple of values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the <local_block>, or na if no
local block is executed. If other local blocks return “bool” values, false will be returned
instead.
This is an example:
It is possible to omit the else block. In this case, if the condition is false, an empty value
( na , false , or "" ) will be assigned to the var_declarationX variable.
This is an example showing how na is returned when no local block is executed. If close >
open is false in here, na is returned:
Scripts can contain if structures with nested if and other conditional structures. For
example:
However, nesting these structures is not recommended from a performance perspective.
When possible, it is typically more optimal to compose a single if statement with multiple
logical operators rather than several nested if blocks:
`switch` structure
The switch structure exists in two forms. One switches on the different values of a key
expression:
The other form does not use an expression as a key; it switches on the evaluation of different
expressions:
where:
Parts enclosed in square brackets ( [] ) can appear zero or one time, and those
enclosed in curly braces ( {} ) can appear zero or more times.
<declaration_mode> is the variable’s declaration mode
<type> is optional, as in almost all Pine Script™ variable declarations (see types)
<identifier> is the variable’s name
<expression> can be a literal, a variable, an expression or a function call.
<local_block> consists of zero or more statements followed by a return value, which can
be a tuple of values. It must be indented by four spaces or a tab.
The value assigned to the variable is the return value of the <local_block>, or na if no
local block is executed.
The => <local_block> at the end allows you to specify a return value which acts as a
default to be used when no other case in the structure is executed.
Only one local block of a switch structure is executed. It is thus a structured switch that
doesn’t fall through cases. Consequently, break statements are unnecessary.
Both forms are allowed as the value used to initialize a variable.
As with the if structure, if no local block is exectuted, the expression returns either false
(when other local blocks return a “bool” value) or na (in all other cases).
`switch` with an expression
Let’s look at an example of a switch using an expression:
Note that:
The expression we are switching on is the variable maType , which is of “input int” type
(see here for an explanation of what the “input” qualifier is). Since it cannot change
during the execution of the script, this guarantees that whichever MA type the user
selects will be executing on each bar, which is a requirement for functions like ta.ema()
which require a “simple int” argument for their length parameter.
If no matching value is found for maType , the switch executes the last local block
introduced by => , which acts as a catch-all. We generate a runtime error in that block.
We also end it with float(na) so the local block returns a value whose type is
compatible with that of the other local blocks in the structure, to avoid a compilation
error.
`switch` without an expression
This is an example of a switch structure which does not use an expression:
Note that:
We are using the switch to select the appropriate strategy order to emit, depending on
whether the longCondition or shortCondition “bool” variables are true .
The building conditions of longCondition and shortCondition are exclusive. While
they can both be false simultaneously, they cannot be true at the same time. The
fact that only one local block of the switch structure is ever executed is thus not an
issue for us.
We evaluate the calls to ta.crossover() and ta.crossunder() prior to entry in the switch
structure. Not doing so, as in the following example, would prevent the functions to be
executed on each bar, which would result in a compiler warning and erratic behavior:
Matching local block type requirement
When multiple local blocks are used in structures, the type of the return value of all its local
blocks must match. This applies only if the structure is used to assign a value to a variable in a
declaration, because a variable can only have one type, and if the statement returns two
incompatible types in its branches, the variable type cannot be properly determined. If the
structure is not assigned anywhere, its branches can return different values.
This code compiles fine because close and open are both of the float type:
This code does not compile because the first local block returns a float value, while the
second one returns a string , and the result of the if -statement is assigned to the x
variable:

Note that:
The script uses the loop’s counter ( i ) to within the history-referencing operator to
retrieve past values of the vwmaOpen series. It also uses the counter to determine the
location of each label drawing.
The loop counter’s value starts at the lookbackInput and decreases by 1 until i == 1 .
Programmers can use for loops to iterate through collections, such as arrays and matrices.
The loop’s counter can serve as an index for retrieving or modifying a collection’s contents.
For example, this code block uses array.get() inside a for loop to successively retrieve
elements from an array:
Note that:
Array indexing starts from 0, but the array.size() function counts the elements (i.e.,
starting from 1). Therefore, we have to subtract one from the array’s size to get the
maximum index value. This way, the loop counter avoids representing an array index that
is out of bounds on the last loop iteration.
The for…in loop statement is often the preferred way to loop through collections.
However, programmers may prefer a for loop for some tasks, such as looping through
stepped index values, iterating over a collection’s contents in reverse or a nonlinear
order, and more. See the Looping through arrays and Looping through matrices sections
to learn more about the best practices for looping through these collection types.
The script below calculates the RSI and momentum of close prices over three different
lengths (10, 20, and 50) and displays their values within a table on the last chart bar. It stores
“string” values for the header title within arrays and the “float” values of the calculated
indicators within a 2x3 matrix. The script uses a for loop to access the elements in the arrays
and initialize the displayTable header cells. It then uses nested for loops to iterate over the
row and column indices in the taMatrix to access its elements, convert their values to
strings, and populate the remaining table cells:
Note that:
Both arrays of header names ( sideHeaderTitles and topHeaderTitles ) contain the
same number of elements, which allows us to iterate through their contents
simultaneously using a single for loop.
The nested for loops iterate over all the index values in the taMatrix . The outer loop
iterates over each row index, and the inner loop iterates over every column index on
each outer loop iteration.
The script creates and displays the table only on the last historical bar and all realtime
bars because the historical states of tables are never visible. See this section of the
Profiling and optimization page for more information.
`while` loops
The while loop statement creates a condition-controlled loop, which uses a conditional
expression to control the executions of its local block. The loop continues its iterations as long
as the conditional expression remains true .
Pine Script™ uses the following syntax to define a while loop:
Where the condition in the loop’s header can be a literal, variable, expression, or function
call that returns a “bool” value.
See the Common characteristics section above for detailed information about the
var_declaration , statements , continue , break , and return_expression parts of the
loop’s syntax.
A while loop’s header evaluates its condition before each iteration. Consequently, when the
script modifies the condition within an iteration, the loop’s header reflects those changes on
the next iteration.
Depending on the specified condition in the loop header, a while loop can behave similarly to
a for loop, continuing iteration until a counter variable reaches a specified limit. For example,
the following script uses a for loop and while loop to perform the same task. Both loops draw
a label displaying their respective counter value on each iteration:
Note that:
When a while loop uses count-based logic, it must explicitly manage the user-specified
counter within the local block. In contrast, a for loop increments its counter
automatically.
The script declares the variable the while loop uses as a counter outside the loop’s
scope, meaning its value is usable in additional calculations after the loop terminates.
If this code did not increment the j variable within the while loop’s body, the value
would never reach 10, meaning the loop would run indefinitely until causing a runtime
error.
Because a while loop’s execution depends on its condition remaining true and the condition
may not change on a specific iteration, the precise number of expected iterations may not be
knowable before the loop begins, unlike a for loop. Therefore, while loops are advantageous in
scenarios where the exact loop boundaries are unknown.
The script below tracks when the chart’s close crosses outside Keltner Channels with a userspecified
length and channel width. When the price crosses outside the current bar’s channel,
the script draws a box highlighting all the previous consecutive bars with close values within
that price window. The script uses a while loop to analyze past bars’ prices and incrementally
adjust the left side of each new box until the drawing covers all the latest consecutive bars in
the current range.
A while loop is necessary in this case because the current bar’s channel values are not
knowable in advance, and we cannot predict the precise number of iterations required to
encapsulate all the consecutive bars within the channel’s range:
Note that:
The left and right edges of boxes sit within the horizontal center of their respective bars,
meaning that each drawing spans from the middle of the first consecutive bar to the
middle of the last bar within each window.
This script uses the i variable as a history-referencing index within the conditional
expression the while loop checks on each iteration. The variable does not behave as a
loop counter, as the iteration boundaries are unknown. The loop executes its local block
repeatedly until the condition becomes false .
`for…in` loops
The for…in loop statement creates a collection-controlled loop, which uses the contents of a
collection to control its iterations. This loop structure is often the preferred approach for
looping through arrays, matrices, and maps.
A for…in loop traverses a collection in order, retrieving one of its stored items on each
iteration. Therefore, the loop’s boundaries depend directly on the number of items (array
elements, matrix rows, or map key-value pairs). As such, similar to a for loop, a script
establishes the expected number of for…in loop iterations before the loop starts.
Pine Script™ features two general forms of the for…in loop statement. The first form uses the
following syntax:
Where item is a variable that holds sequential values from the specified collection_id .
The variable’s value starts with the collection’s first item and takes on successive items in
order after each iteration. This form is convenient when a script must access values from an
array or matrix iteratively but does not require the item’s index in its calculations.
The second form has a slightly different syntax that includes a tuple in its header:
Where index is a variable that contains the index or key of the retrieved item . This form is
convenient when a task requires using a collection’s items and their indices in iterative
calculations. This form of the for…in loop is required when directly iterating through the
contents of a map. See this section for more information.
See the Common characteristics section above for detailed information about the
var_declaration , statements , continue , break , and return_expression parts of the
loop’s syntax.
The iterative behavior of a for…in loop depends on the type of collection the header specifies
as the collection_id :
When using an array in the header, the loop performs element-wise iteration, meaning
the retrieved item on each iteration is one of the array’s elements.
When using a matrix in the header, the loop performs row-wise iteration, which means
that each item represents a row array.
When using a map in the header, the loop performs pair-wise iteration, which retrieves a
key and corresponding value on each iteration.
Looping through arrays
Pine scripts can iterate over the elements of arrays using any loop structure. However, the
for…in loop is typically the most convenient because it automatically verifies the size of an
array when controlling iterations. With other loop structures, programmers must carefully set
the header’s boundaries or conditions to prevent the loop from attempting to access an
element at a nonexistent index.
For example, one can use a for loop to access an array’s elements using the counter variable
as the lookup index in functions such as array.get(). However, to prevent out-of-bounds
errors, programmers must ensure the counter always represents a valid index. Additionally, if
an array might be empty, programmers must set conditions to prevent the loop’s execution
entirely.
The code below shows a for loop whose counter boundaries depend on the number of
elements in an array. If the array is empty, containing 0 elements, the header’s final counter
value is na, which prevents iteration. Otherwise, the final value is one less than the array’s size
(i.e., the index of the last element):
In contrast, a for…in loop automatically validates an array’s size and directly accesses its
elements, providing a more convenient solution than a traditional for loop. The line below
achieves the same effect as the code above without requiring the programmer to define
boundaries explicitly or use the array.get() function to access each element:
The following example examines bars on a lower timeframe to gauge the strength of intrabar
trends within each chart bar. The script uses a request.security_lower_tf() call to retrieve an
array of intrabar hl2 prices from a calculated lowerTimeframe . Then, it uses a for…in loop to
access each price within the intrabarPrices array and compare the value to the current
close to calculate the bar’s strength . The script plots the strength as columns in a
separate pane:
The second form of the for…in loop is a convenient solution when a script’s calculations
require accessing each element and corresponding index within an array:
For example, suppose we want to display a numerated list of array elements within a label
while excluding values at specific indices. We can use the second form of the for…in loop
structure to accomplish this task. The simple script below declares a stringArray variable
that references an array of predefined “string” values. On the last historical bar, the script
uses a for…in loop to access each index and element in the stringArray to construct the
labelText , which it uses in a label.new() call after the loop ends:
Note that:
This example adds 1 to the index in the str.tostring() call to start the numerated list
with a value of “1”, as array indexing always begins at 0.
On the third loop iteration, when index == 2 , the script adds an “ELEMENT SKIPPED”
message to the labelText instead of the retrieved element and uses the continue
keyword to skip the remainder of the iteration. See this section above to learn more
about loop keywords.
Let’s explore an advanced example demonstrating the utility of for…in loops. The following
indicator draws a fixed number of horizontal lines at calculated pivot high levels, and it
analyzes the lines within a loop to determine which ones represent active (uncrossed) pivots.
Each time the script detects a new pivot high point, it creates a new line, inserts that line at
the beginning of the pivotLines array, then removes the oldest element and deletes its ID.
The script accesses each line within the array using a for…in loop, analyzing and modifying
the properties of the pivotLine retrieved on each iteration. When the current high crosses
above the pivotLine , the script changes its style to signify that it is no longer an active level.
Otherwise, it extends the line’s x2 coordinate and uses its price to calculate the average
active pivot value. The script also plots each pivot high value and the average active pivot for
visual reference:
Note that:
The loop in this example executes on every bar because it has to compare each active
pivotLine ’s price with the current high value, and it uses the prices to calculate the
avgActivePivot on each bar.
Pine Script™ features several ways to calculate averages, many of which do not require
a loop. However, a loop is necessary in this example because the script uses information
only available on the current bar to determine which prices contribute toward the
average.
The first form of the for…in loop is the most convenient option in this example because
we need direct access to the lines within the pivotLines array, but we do not need the
corresponding index values.
Looping through matrices
Pine scripts can iterate over the contents of a matrix in several different ways. Unlike arrays,
matrices use two indices to reference their elements because they store data in a rectangular
format. The first index refers to rows, and the second refers to columns. If a programmer opts
to use for or while loops to iterate through matrices instead of using for…in, they must
carefully define the loop boundaries or conditions to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
This code block shows a for loop that performs row-wise iteration, looping through each row
index in a matrix and using the value in a matrix.row() call to retrieve a row array. If the matrix
is empty, the loop statement uses a final loop counter value of na to prevent iteration.
Otherwise, the final counter is one less than the row count, which represents the last row
index:
Note that:
If we replace the matrix.rows() and matrix.row() calls with matrix.columns() and
matrix.col(), the loop performs column-wise iteration instead.
The for…in loop statement is the more convenient approach to loop over and access the rows
of a matrix in order, as it automatically validates the number of rows and retrieves an array of
the current row’s elements on each iteration:
When a script’s calculations require access to each row from a matrix and its corresponding
index, programmers can use the second form of the for…in loop:
Note that:
The for…in loop only performs row-wise iteration on matrices. To emulate column-wise
iteration, programmers can use a for…in loop on a transposed copy.
The following example displays a custom “string” representing the rows of a matrix with extra
information, which it displays within a label. When the script executes on the last historical
bar, it creates a 3x3 randomMatrix populated with random values. Then, using the first form
of the for…in loop, the script iterates through each row in the randomMatrix to create a
“string” representing the row’s contents, its average, and whether the average is above 0.5,
and it concatenates that “string” with the labelText . After the loop ends, the script creates a
label displaying the labelText value:
Working with matrices often entails iteratively accessing their elements, not just their rows
and columns, typically using nested loops. For example, this code block uses an outer for
loop to iterate over row indices. The inner for loop iterates over column indices on each outer
loop iteration and calls matrix.get() to access an element:
Alternatively, a more convenient approach for this type of task is to use nested for…in loops.
The outer for…in loop in this code block retrieves each row array in a matrix, and the inner
for…in statement loops through that array:
The script below creates a 3x2 matrix, then accesses and modifies its elements within nested
for…in loops. Both loops use the second form of the for…in statement to retrieve index values
and corresponding items. The outer loop accesses a row index and row array from the matrix.
The inner loop accesses each index and respective element from that array.
Within the nested loop’s iterations, the script converts each element to a “string” and
initializes a table cell at the rowIndex row and colIndex column. Then, it uses the loop
header variables within matrix.set() to update the matrix element. After the outer loop
terminates, the script displays a “string” representation of the updatedmatrix within a label:
Looping through maps
The for…in loop statement is the primary, most convenient approach for iterating over the data
within Pine Script™ maps.
Unlike arrays and matrices, maps are unordered collections that store data in key-value pairs.
Rather than traversing an internal lookup index, a script references the keys from the pairs
within a map to access its values. Therefore, when looping through a map, scripts must
perform pair-wise iteration, which entails retrieving key-value pairs across iterations rather
than indexed elements or rows.
Note that:
Although maps are unordered collections, Pine Script™ internally tracks the insertion
order of their key-value pairs.
One way to access the data from a map is to use the map.keys() function, which returns an
array containing all the keys from the map, sorted in their insertion order. A script can use the
for…in structure to loop through the array of keys and call map.get() to retrieve corresponding
values:
However, the more convenient, recommended approach is to loop through a map directly
without creating new arrays. To loop through a map directly, use the second form of the for…
in loop statement. Using this loop with a map creates a tuple containing a key and respective
value on each iteration. As when looping through a map.keys() array, this direct for…in loop
iterates through a map’s contents in their insertion order:
Note that:
The second form of the for…in loop is the only way to iterate directly through a map. A
script cannot directly loop through this collection type without retrieving a key and value
on each iteration.
Let’s consider a simple example demonstrating how a for…in loop works on a map. When the
script below executes on the last historical bar, it declares a simpleMap variable with an
assigned map of “string” keys and “float” values. The script puts the keys from the newKeys
array into the collection with corresponding random values. It then uses a for…in loop to
iterate through the key-value pairs from the simpleMap and construct the displayText .
After the loop ends, the script shows the displayText within a label to visualize the result:
Note that:
This script utilizes both forms of the for…in loop statement. The first loop iterates
through the “string” elements of the newKeys array to put key-value pairs into the
simpleMap , and the second iterates directly through the map’s key-value pairs to
construct the custom displayText .

Notice!
Scripts can modify the sizes of arrays and matrices while iterating through them with a
for…in loop. However, it’s crucial to note that while a script iterates through a map with
a for…in loop, that map’s size cannot change. Attempting to add or remove key-value
pairs while looping directly through a map will cause a runtime error.
To modify a map’s size within a loop, programmers can do any of the following:
Make a copy of the map and loop through that copied instance.
Use a for…in loop to iterate through the map.keys() array.
Use a for or while loop instead of a for…in loop.
void
Fundamental types refer to the underlying nature of a value, e.g., a value of 1 is of the “int”
type, 1.0 is of the “float” type, “AAPL” is of the “string” type, etc. Special types and userdefined
types utilize IDs that refer to objects of a specific type. For example, a value of the
“label” type contains an ID that acts as a pointer referring to a “label” object. The “void” type
refers to the output from a function or method that does not return a usable value.
Pine Script™ can automatically convert values from some types into others. The auto-casting
rules are: int → float → bool. See the Type casting section of this page for more information.
In most cases, Pine Script™ can automatically determine a value’s type. However, we can also
use type keywords to explicitly specify types for readability and for code that requires explicit
definitions (e.g., declaring a variable assigned to na). For example:
int
Values of the “int” type represent integers, i.e., whole numbers without any fractional
quantities.
Integer literals are numeric values written in decimal notation. For example:
Built-in variables such as bar_index, time, timenow, dayofmonth, and strategy.wintrades all
return values of the “int” type.
float
Values of the “float” type represent floating-point numbers, i.e., numbers that can contain
whole and fractional quantities.
Floating-point literals are numeric values written with a . delimiter. They may also contain
the symbol e or E (which means “10 raised to the power of X”, where X is the number after
the e or E symbol). For example:
The internal precision of “float” values in Pine Script™ is 1e-16.
Built-in variables such as close, hlcc4, volume, ta.vwap, and strategy.position_size all return
values of the “float” type.
bool
Values of the “bool” type represent the truth value of a comparison or condition, which scripts
can use in conditional structures and other expressions.
There are only two literals that represent boolean values:
A bool variable can never be na, and any conditional structure that can return na will return
false instead. For example, an if condition returns bool values, when the condition is not
met and the else block is not specified, it will returns false .
Built-in variables such as barstate.isfirst, chart.is_heikinashi, session.ismarket, and
timeframe.isdaily all return values of the “bool” type.
color
Color literals have the following format: #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA . The letter pairs represent
hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (0 to 255 in decimal) where:
RR , GG and BB pairs respectively represent the values for the color’s red, green and
blue components.
AA is an optional value for the color’s opacity (or alpha component) where 00 is
invisible and FF opaque. When the literal does not include an AA pair, the script treats
it as fully opaque (the same as using FF ).
The hexadecimal letters in the literals can be uppercase or lowercase.
These are examples of “color” literals:
Pine Script™ also has built-in color constants, including color.green, color.red, color.orange,
color.blue (the default color in plot*() functions and many of the default color-related
properties in drawing types), etc.
When using built-in color constants, it is possible to add transparency information to them via
the color.new() function.
Note that when specifying red, green or blue components in color.*() functions, we use
“int” or “float” arguments with values between 0 and 255. When specifying transparency, we
use a value between 0 and 100, where 0 means fully opaque and 100 means completely
transparent. For example:
See the User Manual’s page on colors for more information on using colors in scripts.
string
Values of the “string” type represent sequences of letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, and
other characters.
String literals in Pine are characters enclosed in single or double quotation marks. For
example:
Single and double quotation marks are functionally equivalent in Pine Script™. A “string”
enclosed within double quotation marks can contain any number of single quotation marks
and vice versa:
Scripts can escape the enclosing delimiter in a “string” using the backslash character ( \ ).
For example:
We can create “string” values containing the new line escape character ( \n ) for displaying
multi-line text with plot*() and log.*() functions and objects of drawing types. For
example:
We can use the + operator to concatenate “string” values:
The built-ins in the str.*() namespace create “string” values using specialized operations.
For instance, this script creates a formatted string to represent “float” price values and
displays the result using a label:
See our User Manual’s page on Text and shapes for more information about displaying
“string” values from a script.
Built-in variables such as syminfo.tickerid, syminfo.currency, and timeframe.period return
values of the “string” type.
plot and hline
Pine Script™‘s plot() and hline() functions return IDs that respectively reference instances of
the “plot” and “hline” types. These types display calculated values and horizontal levels on
the chart, and one can assign their IDs to variables for use with the built-in fill() function.
For example, this script plots two EMAs on the chart and fills the space between them using a
fill() call:
It’s important to note that unlike other special types, there is no plot or hline keyword in
Pine to explicitly declare a variable’s type as “plot” or “hline”.
Users can control where their scripts’ plots display via the variables in the display.*
namespace and a plot*() function’s force_overlay parameter. Additionally, one script can
use the values from another script’s plots as external inputs via the input.source() function
(see our User Manual’s section on source inputs).
Drawing types
Pine Script™ drawing types allow scripts to create custom drawings on charts. They include
the following: line, linefill, box, polyline, label, and table.
Each type also has a namespace containing all the built-ins that create and manage drawing
instances. For example, the following *.new() constructors create new objects of these
types in a script: line.new(), linefill.new(), box.new(), polyline.new(), label.new(), and
table.new().
Each of these functions returns an ID which is a reference that uniquely identifies a drawing
object. IDs are always qualified as “series”, meaning their qualified types are “series line”,
“series label”, etc. Drawing IDs act like pointers, as each ID references a specific instance of a
drawing in all the functions from that drawing’s namespace. For instance, the ID of a line
returned by a line.new() call is used later to refer to that specific object once it’s time to
delete it with line.delete().
Chart points
Chart points are special types that represent coordinates on the chart. Scripts use the
information from chart.point objects to determine the chart locations of lines, boxes,
polylines, and labels.
Objects of this type contain three fields: time , index , and price . Whether a drawing
instance uses the time or price field from a chart.point as an x-coordinate depends on the
drawing’s xloc property.
We can use any of the following functions to create chart points in a script:
chart.point.new() - Creates a new chart.point with a specified time , index , and
price .
chart.point.now() - Creates a new chart.point with a specified price y-coordinate. The
time and index fields contain the time and bar_index of the bar the function executes
on.
chart.point_from_index() - Creates a new chart.point with an index x-coordinate and
price y-coordinate. The time field of the resulting instance is na, meaning it will not
work with drawing objects that use an xloc value of xloc.bar_time.
chart.point.from_time() - Creates a new chart.point with a time x-coordinate and
price y-coordinate. The index field of the resulting instance is na, meaning it will not
work with drawing objects that use an xloc value of xloc.bar_index.
chart.point.copy() - Creates a new chart.point containing the same time , index , and
price information as the id in the function call.
This example draws lines connecting the previous bar’s high to the current bar’s low on each
chart bar. It also displays labels at both points of each line. The line and labels get their
information from the firstPoint and secondPoint variables, which reference chart points
created using chart.point_from_index() and chart.point.now():
Collections
Collections in Pine Script™ (arrays, matrices, and maps) utilize reference IDs, much like other
special types (e.g., labels). The type of the ID defines the type of elements the collection will
contain. In Pine, we specify array, matrix, and map types by appending a type template to the
array, matrix, or map keywords:
array<int> defines an array containing “int” elements.
array<label> defines an array containing “label” IDs.
array<UDT> defines an array containing IDs referencing objects of a user-defined type
(UDT).
matrix<float> defines a matrix containing “float” elements.
matrix<UDT> defines a matrix containing IDs referencing objects of a user-defined type
(UDT).
map<string, float> defines a map containing “string” keys and “float” values.
map<int, UDT> defines a map containing “int” keys and IDs of user-defined type (UDT)
instances as values.
For example, one can declare an “int” array with a single element value of 10 in any of the
following, equivalent ways:
Note that:
The int[] syntax can also specify an array of “int” elements, but its use is
discouraged. No equivalent exists to specify the types of matrices or maps in that way.
Type-specific built-ins exist for arrays, such as array.new_int(), but the more generic
array.new<type> form is preferred, which would be array.new<int>() to create an
array of “int” elements.
User-defined types
The type keyword allows the creation of user-defined types (UDTs) from which scripts can
create objects. UDTs are composite types; they contain an arbitrary number of fields that can
be of any type, including other user-defined types.
The syntax to declare a user-defined type is:
[export ]type <UDT_identifier>
<field_type> <field_name>[ = <value>]
...
where:
export is the keyword that a library script uses to export the user-defined type. To learn
more about exporting UDTs, see our User Manual’s Libraries page.
<UDT_identifier> is the name of the user-defined type.
<field_type> is the type of the field.
<field_name> is the name of the field.
<value> is an optional default value for the field, which the script will assign to it when
creating new objects of that UDT. If one does not provide a value, the field’s default is
na. The same rules as those governing the default values of parameters in function
signatures apply to the default values of fields. For example, a UDT’s default values
cannot use results from the history-referencing operator [] or expressions.
This example declares a pivotPoint UDT with an “int” pivotTime field and a “float”
priceLevel field that will respectively hold time and price information about a calculated
pivot:
User-defined types support type recursion, i.e., the fields of a UDT can reference objects of
the same UDT. Here, we’ve added a nextPivot field to our previous pivotPoint type that
references another pivotPoint instance:
Scripts can use two built-in methods to create and copy UDTs: new() and copy() . See our
User Manual’s page on Objects to learn more about working with UDTs.
Enum types
The enum keyword allows the creation of an enum, otherwise known as an enumeration,
enumerated type, or enum type. An enum is a unique type construct containing distinct,
named fields representing members (i.e., possible values) of the type. Enums allow
programmers to control the values accepted by variables, conditional expressions, and
collections, and they facilitate convenient dropdown input creation with the input.enum()
function.
The syntax to declare an enum is as follows:
[export ]enum <enumName>
<field_1>[ = <title_1>]
<field_2>[ = <title_2>]
...
<field_N>[ = <title_N>]
where:
export is the optional keyword allowing a library to export the enum for use in other
scripts. See this section to learn more about exporting enum types.
<enumName> is the name of the enum type. Scripts can use the enum’s name as the type
keyword in variable declarations and type templates.
<field_*> is the name of an enum field, representing a named member (value) of the
enumName type. Each field must have a unique name that does not match the name or
title of any other field in the enum. To retrieve an enum member, reference its field name
using dot notation syntax (i.e., enumName.fieldName ).
<title_*> is a “const string” title assigned to a field. If one does not specify a title, the
field’s title is the “string” representation of its name. The input.enum() function displays
field titles within its dropdown in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. Users can also
retrieve a field’s title with the str.tostring() function. As with field names, each field’s title
must not match the name or title of any other field in the enum.
This example declares an maChoice enum. Each field within this declaration represents a
distinct member of the maChoice enum type:
Note that:
All the enum’s possible values are available upon the first script execution and do not
change across subsequent executions. Hence, they automatically adopt the simple
qualifier.
The script below uses the maChoice enum within an input.enum() call to create a dropdown
input in the “Settings/Inputs” tab that displays all the field titles. The maInput value
represents the member of the enum that corresponds to the user-selected title. The script
uses the selected member within a switch structure to determine the built-in moving average
it calculates:
See the Enums page and the Enum input section of the Inputs page to learn more about using
enums and enum inputs.
void
There is a “void” type in Pine Script™. Functions having only side-effects and returning no
usable result return the “void” type. An example of such a function is alert(); it does
something (triggers an alert event), but it returns no usable value.
Scripts cannot use “void” results in expressions or assign them to variables. No void
keyword exists in Pine Script™ since one cannot declare a variable of the “void” type.
`na` value
There is a special value in Pine Script™ called na, which is an acronym for not available. We
use na to represent an undefined value from a variable or expression. It is similar to null in
Java and None in Python.
Scripts can automatically cast na values to almost any type. However, in some cases, the
compiler cannot infer the type associated with an na value because more than one typecasting
rule may apply. For example:
The above line of code causes a compilation error because the compiler cannot determine the
nature of the myVar variable, i.e., whether the variable will reference numeric values for
plotting, string values for setting text in a label, or other values for some other purpose later in
the script’s execution.
To resolve such errors, we must explicitly declare the type associated with the variable.
Suppose the myVar variable will reference “float” values in subsequent script iterations. We
can resolve the error by declaring the variable with the float keyword:
or by explicitly casting the na value to the “float” type via the float() function:
To test if the value from a variable or expression is na, we call the na() function, which returns
true if the value is undefined. For example:
Do not use the == comparison operator to test for na values, as scripts cannot determine the
equality of an undefined value:
Best coding practices often involve handling na values to prevent undefined values in
calculations.
We can ensure the expression also returns an actionable value on the first bar by replacing
the undefined past value with a value from the current bar. This line of code uses the nz()
function to replace the past bar’s close with the current bar’s open when the value is na:
Protecting scripts against na instances helps to prevent undefined values from propagating in
a calculation’s results. For example, this script declares an allTimeHigh variable on the first
bar. It then uses the math.max() between the allTimeHigh and the bar’s high to update the
allTimeHigh throughout its execution:
This script plots a value of na on all bars, as we have not included any na protection in the
code. To fix the behavior and plot the intended result (i.e., the all-time high of the chart’s
prices), we can use nz() to replace na values in the allTimeHigh series:
Type templates
Type templates specify the data types that collections (arrays, matrices, and maps) can
contain.
Templates for arrays and matrices consist of a single type identifier surrounded by angle
brackets, e.g., <int> , <label> , and <PivotPoint> (where PivotPoint is a user-defined
type (UDT)).
Templates for maps consist of two type identifiers enclosed in angle brackets, where the first
specifies the type of keys in each key-value pair, and the second specifies the value type. For
example, <string, float> is a type template for a map that holds string keys and float
values.
Users can construct type templates from:
Fundamental types: int, float, bool, color, and string
The following special types: line, linefill, box, polyline, label, table, and chart.point
User-defined types (UDTs)
Enum types
Note that:
Maps can use any of these types as values, but they can only accept fundamental types
or enum types as keys.
Scripts use type templates to declare variables that reference collections, and when creating
new collection instances. For example:
Type casting
Pine Script™ includes an automatic type-casting mechanism that casts (converts) “int”
values to “float” when necessary. Variables or expressions requiring “float” values can also
use “int” values because any integer can be represented as a floating point number with its
fractional part equal to 0.
It’s sometimes necessary to cast one type to another when auto-casting rules do not suffice.
For such cases, the following type-casting functions are available: int(), float(), bool(), color(),
string(), line(), linefill(), label(), box(), and table().
The example below shows a code that tries to use a “const float” value as the length
argument in the ta.sma() function call. The script will fail to compile, as it cannot automatically
convert the “float” value to the required “int” type:
The code raises the following error: “Cannot call ‘ta.sma’ with argument ‘length’=‘LENGTH’.
An argument of ‘const float’ type was used but a ‘series int’ is expected.”
The compiler is telling us that the code is using a “float” value where an “int” is required.
There is no auto-casting rule to cast a “float” to an “int”, so we must do the job ourselves. In
this version of the code, we’ve used the int() function to explicitly convert our “float” LENGTH
value to the “int” type within the ta.sma() call:
Explicit type casting is also handy when declaring variables assigned to na, as explained in the
previous section.
For example, once could explicitly declare a variable with a value of na as a “label” type in
either of the following, equivalent ways:
Tuples
A tuple is a comma-separated set of expressions enclosed in brackets. When a function,
method, or other local block returns more than one value, scripts return those values in the
form of a tuple.
For example, the following user-defined function returns the sum and product of two “float”
values:
When we call this function later in the script, we use a tuple declaration to declare multiple
variables corresponding to the values returned by the function call:
Keep in mind that unlike declaring single variables, we cannot explicitly define the types the
tuple’s variables ( hlSum and hlProduct in this case), will contain. The compiler
automatically infers the types associated with the variables in a tuple.
In the above example, the resulting tuple contains values of the same type (“float”). However,
it’s important to note that tuples can contain values of multiple types. For example, the
chartInfo() function below returns a tuple containing “int”, “float”, “bool”, “color”, and
“string” values:
Tuples are especially handy for requesting multiple values in one request.security() call.
For instance, this roundedOHLC() function returns a tuple containing OHLC values rounded to
the nearest prices that are divisible by the symbol’s minimum tick value. We call this function
as the expression argument in request.security() to request a tuple containing daily OHLC
values:
We can also achieve the same result by directly passing a tuple of rounded values as the
expression in the request.security() call:
Local blocks of conditional structures, including if and switch statements, can return tuples.
For example:
and:
However, ternaries cannot contain tuples, as the return values in a ternary statement are not
considered local blocks:
Note that all items within a tuple returned from a function are qualified as “simple” or “series”,
depending on its contents. If a tuple contains a “series” value, all other elements within the
tuple will also adopt the “series” qualifier. For example:

Built-ins
Introduction
Pine Script™ has hundreds of built-in variables and functions. They provide your scripts with
valuable information and make calculations for you, dispensing you from coding them. The
better you know the built-ins, the more you will be able to do with your Pine scripts.
In this page we present an overview of some of Pine Script™‘s built-in variables and functions.
They will be covered in more detail in the pages of this manual covering specific themes.
All built-in variables and functions are defined in the Pine Script™ v6 Reference Manual. It is
called a “Reference Manual” because it is the definitive reference on the Pine Script™
language. It is an essential tool that will accompany you anytime you code in Pine, whether
you are a beginner or an expert. If you are learning your first programming language, make the
Reference Manual your friend. Ignoring it will make your programming experience with Pine
Script™ difficult and frustrating — as it would with any other programming language.
Variables and functions in the same family share the same namespace, which is a prefix to the
function’s name. The ta.sma() function, for example, is in the ta namespace, which stands
for “technical analysis”. A namespace can contain both variables and functions.
Some variables have function versions as well, e.g.:
The ta.tr variable returns the “True Range” of the current bar. The ta.tr(true) function call
also returns the “True Range”, but when the previous close value which is normally
needed to calculate it is na, it calculates using high - low instead.
The time variable gives the time at the open of the current bar. The time(timeframe)
function returns the time of the bar’s open from the timeframe specified, even if the
chart’s timeframe is different. The time(timeframe, session) function returns the time of
the bar’s open from the timeframe specified, but only if it is within the session time.
The time(timeframe, session, timezone) function returns the time of the bar’s open from
the timeframe specified, but only if it is within the session time in the specified
timezone .
Built-in variables
Built-in variables exist for different purposes. These are a few examples:
Price- and volume-related variables: open, high, low, close, hl2, hlc3, ohlc4, and volume.
Symbol-related information in the syminfo namespace: syminfo.basecurrency,
syminfo.currency, syminfo.description, syminfo.mintick, syminfo.pointvalue,
syminfo.prefix, syminfo.root, syminfo.session, syminfo.ticker, syminfo.tickerid,
syminfo.timezone, and syminfo.type.
Timeframe (a.k.a. “interval” or “resolution”, e.g., 15sec, 30min, 60min, 1D, 3M) variables
in the timeframe namespace: timeframe.isseconds, timeframe.isminutes,
timeframe.isintraday, timeframe.isdaily, timeframe.isweekly, timeframe.ismonthly,
timeframe.isdwm, timeframe.multiplier, and timeframe.period.
Bar states in the barstate namespace (see the Bar states page): barstate.isconfirmed,
barstate.isfirst, barstate.ishistory, barstate.islast, barstate.islastconfirmedhistory,
barstate.isnew, and barstate.isrealtime.
Strategy-related information in the strategy namespace: strategy.equity,
strategy.initial_capital, strategy.grossloss, strategy.grossprofit, strategy.wintrades,
strategy.losstrades, strategy.position_size, strategy.position_avg_price,
strategy.wintrades, etc.
Built-in functions
Many functions are used for the result(s) they return. These are a few examples:
Math-related functions in the math namespace: math.abs(), math.log(), math.max(),
math.random(), math.round_to_mintick(), etc.
Technical indicators in the ta namespace: ta.sma(), ta.ema(), ta.macd(), ta.rsi(),
ta.supertrend(), etc.
Support functions often used to calculate technical indicators in the ta namespace:
ta.barssince(), ta.crossover(), ta.highest(), etc.
Functions to request data from other symbols or timeframes in the request
namespace: request.dividends(), request.earnings(), request.financial(),
request.quandl(), request.security(), request.splits().
Functions to manipulate strings in the str namespace: str.format(), str.length(),
str.tonumber(), str.tostring(), etc.
Functions used to define the input values that script users can modify in the script’s
“Settings/Inputs” tab, in the input namespace: input(), input.color(), input.int(),
input.session(), input.symbol(), etc.
Functions used to manipulate colors in the color namespace: color.from_gradient(),
color.new(), color.rgb(), etc.
Some functions do not return a result but are used for their side effects, which means they do
something, even if they don’t return a result:
Functions used as a declaration statement defining one of three types of Pine scripts,
and its properties. Each script must begin with a call to one of these functions:
indicator(), strategy() or library().
Plotting or coloring functions: bgcolor(), plotbar(), plotcandle(), plotchar(), plotshape(),
fill().
Strategy functions placing orders, in the strategy namespace: strategy.cancel(),
strategy.close(), strategy.entry(), strategy.exit(), strategy.order(), etc.
Strategy functions returning information on indivdual past trades, in the strategy
namespace: strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index(),
strategy.closedtrades.entry_price(), strategy.closedtrades.entry_time(),
strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index(), strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown(),
strategy.closedtrades.max_runup(), strategy.closedtrades.profit(), etc.
Functions to generate alert events: alert() and alertcondition().
Other functions return a result, but we don’t always use it, e.g.: hline(), plot(), array.pop(),
label.new(), etc.
All built-in functions are defined in the Pine Script™ v6 Reference Manual. You can click on
any of the function names listed here to go to its entry in the Reference Manual, which
documents the function’s signature, i.e., the list of parameters it accepts and the qualified
type of the value(s) it returns (a function can return more than one result). The Reference
Manual entry will also list, for each parameter:
Its name.
The qualified type of the value it requires (we use argument to name the values passed
to a function when calling it).
If the parameter is required or not.
All built-in functions have one or more parameters defined in their signature. Not all
parameters are required for every function.
Let’s look at the ta.vwma() function, which returns the volume-weighted moving average of a
source value. This is its entry in the Reference Manual:
The entry gives us the information we need to use it:
What the function does.
Its signature (or definition):
The parameters it includes: source and length
The qualified type of the result it returns: “series float”.
An example showing it in use: plot(ta.vwma(close, 15)) .
An example showing what it does, but in long form, so you can better understand its
calculations. Note that this is meant to explain --- not as usable code, because it is more
complicated and takes longer to execute. There are only disadvantages to using the
long form.
The “RETURNS” section explains exacty what value the function returns.
The “ARGUMENTS” section lists each parameter and gives the critical information
concerning what qualified type is required for arguments used when calling the function.
The “SEE ALSO” section refers you to related Reference Manual entries.
This is a call to the function in a line of code that declares a myVwma variable and assigns the
result of ta.vwma(close, 20) to it:
Note that:
We use the built-in variable close as the argument for the source parameter.
We use 20 as the argument for the length parameter.
If placed in the global scope (i.e., starting in a line’s first position), it will be executed by
the Pine Script™ runtime on each bar of the chart.
We can also use the parameter names when calling the function. Parameter names are called
keyword arguments when used in a function call:
You can change the position of arguments when using keyword arguments, but only if you use
them for all your arguments. When calling functions with many parameters such as
indicator(), you can also forego keyword arguments for the first arguments, as long as you
don’t skip any. If you skip some, you must then use keyword arguments so the Pine Script™
compiler can figure out which parameter they correspond to, e.g.:
Mixing things up this way is not allowed:
When calling built-ins, it is critical to ensure that the arguments you use are of the
required qualified type, which will vary for each parameter.
To learn how to do this, one needs to understand Pine Script™‘s type system. The Reference
Manual entry for each built-in function includes an “ARGUMENTS” section which lists the
qualified type required for the argument supplied to each of the function’s parameters.

User Manual / Language / User-defined functions
User-defined functions
Introduction
User-defined functions are functions that you write, as opposed to the built-in functions in
Pine Script™. They are useful to define calculations that you must do repetitevely, or that you
want to isolate from your script’s main section of calculations. Think of user-defined functions
as a way to extend the capabilities of Pine Script™, when no built-in function will do what you
need.
You can write your functions in two ways:
In a single line, when they are simple, or
On multiple lines
Functions can be located in two places:
If a function is only used in one script, you can include it in the script where it is used.
See our Style guide for recommendations on where to place functions in your script.
You can create a Pine Script™ library to include your functions, which makes them
reusable in other scripts without having to copy their code. Distinct requirements exist
for library functions. They are explained in the page on libraries.
Whether they use one line or multiple lines, user-defined functions have the following
characteristics:
They cannot be embedded. All functions are defined in the script’s global scope.
They do not support recursion. It is not allowed for a function to call itself from within
its own code.
The type of the value returned by a function is determined automatically and depends
on the type of arguments used in each particular function call.
A function’s returned value is that of the last value in the function’s body.
Each instance of a function call in a script maintains its own, independent history.
Single-line functions
Simple functions can often be written in one line. This is the formal definition of single-line
functions:
Here is an example:
After the function f() has been declared, it’s possible to call it using different types of
arguments:
In the example above, the type of variable a is series because the arguments are both series.
The type of variable b is integer because arguments are both literal integers. The type of
variable c is series because the addition of a series and literal integer produces a series
result.
Multi-line functions
Pine Script™ also supports multi-line functions with the following syntax:
where:
The body of a multi-line function consists of several statements. Each statement is placed on
a separate line and must be preceded by 1 indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab). The indentation
before the statement indicates that it is a part of the body of the function and not part of the
script’s global scope. After the function’s code, the first statement without an indent indicates
the body of the function has ended.
Either an expression or a declared variable should be the last statement of the function’s
body. The result of this expression (or variable) will be the result of the function’s call. For
example:
The function geom_average has two arguments and creates two variables in the body: a and
b . The last statement calls the function math.sqrt (an extraction of the square root). The
geom_average call will return the value of the last expression: (math.sqrt(a + b)) .
Scopes in the script
Variables declared outside the body of a function or of other local blocks belong to the global
scope. User-declared and built-in functions, as well as built-in variables also belong to the
global scope.
Each function has its own local scope. All the variables declared within the function, as well as
the function’s arguments, belong to the scope of that function, meaning that it is impossible
to reference them from outside --- e.g., from the global scope or the local scope of another
function.
On the other hand, since it is possible to refer to any variable or function declared in the
global scope from the scope of a function (except for self-referencing recursive calls), one
can say that the local scope is embedded into the global scope.
In Pine Script™, nested functions are not allowed, i.e., one cannot declare a function inside
another one. All user functions are declared in the global scope. Local scopes cannot
intersect with each other.
Functions that return multiple results
In most cases a function returns only one result, but it is possible to return a list of results (a
tuple-like result):
Special syntax is required for calling such functions:
Limitations
User-defined functions can use any of the Pine Script™ built-ins, except: barcolor(), fill(),
hline(), indicator(), library(), plot(), plotbar(), plotcandle(), plotchar(), plotshape() and
strategy().

Objects
Introduction
Pine Script™ objects are instances of user-defined types (UDTs). They are the equivalent of
variables containing parts called fields, each able to hold independent values that can be of
various types.
Experienced programmers can think of UDTs as methodless classes. They allow users to
create custom types that organize different values under one logical entity.
Creating objects
Before an object can be created, its type must be defined. The User-defined types section of
the Type system page explains how to do so.
Let’s define a pivotPoint type to hold pivot information:
Note that:
We use the type keyword to declare the creation of a UDT.
We name our new UDT pivotPoint .
After the first line, we create a local block containing the type and name of each field.
The x field will hold the x-coordinate of the pivot. It is declared as an “int” because it
will hold either a timestamp or a bar index of “int” type.
y is a “float” because it will hold the pivot’s price.
xloc is a field that will specify the units of x : xloc.bar_index or xloc.bar_time. We set
its default value to xloc.bar_time by using the = operator. When an object is created
from that UDT, its xloc field will thus be set to that value.
Now that our pivotPoint UDT is defined, we can proceed to create objects from it. We
create objects using the UDT’s new() built-in method. To create a new foundPoint object
from our pivotPoint UDT, we use:
We can also specify field values for the created object using the following:
Or the equivalent:
At this point, the foundPoint object’s x field will contain the value of the time built-in when
it is created, y will contain the value of high and the xloc field will contain its default value
of xloc.bar_time because no value was defined for it when creating the object.
Object placeholders can also be created by declaring na object names using the following:
This example displays a label where high pivots are detected. The pivots are detected
legsInput bars after they occur, so we must plot the label in the past for it to appear on the
pivot:
Take note of this line from the above example:
This could also be written using the following:
When using the var keyword while declaring a variable assigned to an object of a user-defined
type, the keyword automatically applies to all the object’s fields:
It’s important to note that assigning an object to a variable that uses the varip keyword does
not automatically allow the object’s fields to persist without rolling back on each intrabar
update. One must apply the keyword to each desired field in the type declaration to achieve
this behavior. For example:
Note that:
We used the var keyword to specify that the Counter object assigned to the counter
variable persists throughout the script’s execution.
The bars field rolls back on realtime bars, whereas the ticks field does not since we
included varip in its declaration.
Changing field values
The value of an object’s fields can be changed using the := reassignment operator.
This line of our previous example:
Could be written using the following:
Collecting objects
Pine Script™ collections (arrays, matrices, and maps) can contain objects, allowing users to
add virtual dimensions to their data structures. To declare a collection of objects, pass a UDT
name into its type template.
This example declares an empty array that will hold objects of a pivotPoint user-defined
type:
To explicitly declare the type of a variable as an array, matrix, or map of a user-defined type,
use the collection’s type keyword followed by its type template. For example:
Let’s use what we have learned to create a script that detects high pivot points. The script
first collects historical pivot information in an array. It then loops through the array on the last
historical bar, creating a label for each pivot and connecting the pivots with lines:
Copying objects
In Pine, objects are assigned by reference. When an existing object is assigned to a new
variable, both point to the same object.
In the example below, we create a pivot1 object and set its x field to 1000. Then, we
declare a pivot2 variable containing the reference to the pivot1 object, so both point to
the same instance. Changing pivot2.x will thus also change pivot1.x , as both refer to the
x field of the same object:
To create a copy of an object that is independent of the original, we can use the built-in
copy() method in this case.
In this example, we declare the pivot2 variable referring to a copied instance of the pivot1
object. Now, changing pivot2.x will not change pivot1.x , as it refers to the x field of a
separate object:
It’s important to note that the built-in copy() method produces a shallow copy of an object.
If an object has fields with special types (array, matrix, map, line, linefill, box, polyline, label,
table, or chart.point), those fields in a shallow copy of the object will point to the same
instances as the original.
In the following example, we have defined an InfoLabel type with a label as one of its fields.
The script instantiates a shallow copy of the parent object, then calls a user-defined
set() method to update the info and lbl fields of each object. Since the lbl field of
both objects points to the same label instance, changes to this field in either object affect the
other:
To produce a deep copy of an object with all of its special type fields pointing to independent
instances, we must explicitly copy those fields as well.
In this example, we have defined a deepCopy() method that instantiates a new InfoLabel
object with its lbl field pointing to a copy of the original’s field. Changes to the deep copy’s
lbl field will not affect the parent object, as it points to a separate instance:
Shadowing
To avoid potential conflicts in the eventuality where namespaces added to Pine Script™ in the
future would collide with UDTs or object names in existing scripts; as a rule, UDTs and object
names shadow the language’s namespaces. For example, a UDT or object can use the name
of built-in types, such as line or table.
Only the language’s five primitive types cannot be used to name UDTs or objects: int, float,
string, bool, and color.

Enums
Introduction
Pine Script™ Enums, otherwise known as enumerations, enumerated types, or enum types,
are unique data types with all possible values (members) explicitly defined by the
programmer. They provide a human-readable, expressive way to declare distinct sets of
predefined values that variables, conditional expressions, and collections can accept, allowing
more strict control over the values used in a script’s logic.
Declaring an enum
To declare an enum, use the enum keyword with the following syntax:
Each field in the enum represents a unique, named member (value) of the enum type. Users
can specify optional “const string” titles for enum fields to add extra information about what
their values represent. If the programmer does not specify a field’s title, its title is the “string”
representation of its name. Enum inputs display enum field titles within their dropdown menus
in a script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. Scripts can also retrieve enum field titles using the
str.tostring() function, allowing their use in additional calculations. See this section below for
more information.
While the above syntax may look similar to the syntax for declaring user-defined types
(UDTs), it’s crucial to understand that enum types and UDTs serve different purposes. Scripts
use UDTs to create objects with “series” fields that can hold values of any specified type. In
contrast, enums are distinct groups of “simple” fields representing the specific, predefined
values of the same unique type that variables, expressions, and collections can accept.
For example, this code block declares a Signal enum with three fields: buy , sell , and
neutral . Each field represents a distinct member (possible value) of the Signal enum type:
Note that:
The Signal identifier represents the enum’s name, which signifies the unique type the
fields belong to.
We used the //@enum and //@field annotations to document the meaning of the
enum and its fields.
Unlike the buy and sell fields, the neutral field does not include a specified title. As
such, its title is the “string” representation of its name (“neutral”).
To retrieve a member of an enum, reference its field name using dot notation syntax, i.e.:
As with other types, scripts can assign enum members to variables, function parameters, and
UDT fields, allowing strict control over their allowed values.
For instance, this line of code declares a mySignal variable whose value is the neutral
member of the Signal enum. Any value assigned to this variable later must also be of the
same enum type:
Note that the above line does not require declaring the variable’s type as Signal because
the compiler can automatically infer that information from the assigned value. If we use na as
the initial value instead, we must use Signal as the type keyword to specify that mySignal
will accept a Signal member:
Using enums
Scripts can compare enum members with the == and != operators and use them in conditional
structures, allowing the convenient creation of logical patterns with a reduced risk of
unintended values or operations.
The following example declares an OscType enum with three fields representing different
oscillator choices: rsi , mfi , and cci . The calcOscillator() function uses OscType
members within a switch structure to determine which oscillator it calculates. The script calls
this function using the value from an enum input as the selection argument and plots the
resulting oscillator:
Note that:
The selection parameter of the calcOscillator() function can only take on one of
four values: OscType.rsi , OscType.mfi , OscType.cci , or na.
The “Oscillator type” input in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab displays all OscType field
titles in its dropdown. See this section to learn more about enum inputs.
It’s crucial to note that each declared enum represents a unique type. Scripts cannot
compare members of different enums or use such members in expressions requiring a
specific enum type, even if the fields have identical names and titles.
In this example, we added an OscType2 enum to the above script and changed the oscInput
variable to use a member of that enum. The script now raises a compilation error because it
can’t use a member of the OscType2 enum as the selection argument in the
calcOscillator() call:
Utilizing field titles
The “string” titles of an enum’s fields allow programmers to add extra information to each
member. These field titles appear within a dropdown in the script’s “Settings/Inputs” tab when
calling the input.enum() function.
Scripts can also utilize enum field titles in their calculations and logic. Use the string
conversion function (str.tostring()) on an enum field to access its title.
The following example combines different enum field titles to construct a ticker ID for
requesting data from another context. The script declares two enums, Exchange and Pair ,
whose respective fields represent exchange and currency pair names. It uses input.enum() to
assign user-specified enum members to the exchangeInput and pairInput variables, then
retrieves the “string” titles from those variables with str.tostring() and concatenates them to
form an “Exchange:Symbol” pair for use in a request.security() call:
Note that:
None of the members of the Exchange or Pair enums have specified titles. Therefore,
each field’s title is the “string” representation of its name, as shown by the script’s enum
inputs.
Calling the str.tostring() function on an enum field is the only way to retrieve its title for
additional calculations. The str.format() and log.*() functions cannot accept enum
members. To use a field’s title in a string formatting function, call str.tostring() on the
field first, then pass the resulting “string” to the function.
Collecting enum members
Pine Script™ collections (arrays, matrices, and maps) can store enum members, allowing
strict control over the values they can contain. To declare a collection of enum members,
include the enum’s name in the collection’s type template.
For example, this code block creates an empty array to hold members of the FooBar enum.
The only values this array can allow as elements are FooBar.foo , FooBar.bar , FooBar.baz ,
and na:
Enums are particularly helpful when working with maps, as unlike other non-fundamental
types, scripts can declare maps with keys of an enum type, enabling strict control over all
possible keys allowed in their key-value pairs.
The following example uses a map with enum keys and “int” values to track and count signal
states across chart bars. The script’s Signal enum contains five fields representing specific
named states. The signalCounters map uses the Signal name as the first keyword in its
type template to specify that it can only accept Signal members as keys.
The script uses a switch structure to calculate a signalState variable whose value is a
member of the Signal enum, which it uses to determine the counter value to update in the
signalCounters map. It constructs a “string” to represent the key-value pairs of the map and
displays the result in a single-cell table on the last chart bar:
Note that:
The signalCounters map can contain up to six key-value pairs, as the Signal enum
has five predefined values, plus a possible value of na, and maps cannot contain
repetitive keys.
The script declares the signalCounters variable using the var keyword, signifying that
the assigned map instance persists across executions.
On the first chart bar, the script uses five map.put() calls to establish the insertion order
of keys in the signalCounters map. See this section of the Maps page for more
information.
To minimize resource usage, the script declares the infoTable and initializes its cell on
the first bar, then updates the cell’s text on the latest bar. See this section of the
Profiling and optimization page to learn more.
Shadowing
To avoid potential conflicts where namespaces added to Pine Script™ in the future would
conflict with the names of enums in existing scripts, enum names can shadow some of Pine’s
namespaces.
For example, one can declare an enum like the following, whose name shadows the
syminfo.* namespace:
However, using such a name for an enum is only allowed if the enum’s fields do not have
names matching any of the namespace’s built-ins. Otherwise, Pine will not be able to
determine which value the script is supposed to use, resulting in a compilation error:
Additionally, one cannot use any of Pine’s built-in type names as the name of an enum.

Methods
Introduction
Pine Script™ methods are specialized functions associated with values of specific built-in
types, user-defined types, or enum types. They behave the same as regular functions in most
regards while offering a shorter, more convenient syntax. Users can access methods using
dot notation syntax on variables of the associated type, similar to accessing the fields of a
Pine Script™ object.
Built-in methods
Pine Script™ includes built-in methods for all special types, including array, matrix, map, line,
linefill, box, polyline, label, and table. These methods provide users with a more concise way
to call specialized routines for these types within their scripts.
When using these special types, the expressions:
and:
are equivalent. For example, rather than using:
to get the value from an array id at the specified index , we can simply use:
to achieve the same effect. This notation eliminates the need for users to reference the
function’s namespace, as get() is a method of id in this context.
Written below is a practical example to demonstrate the usage of built-in methods in place of
functions.
The following script computes Bollinger Bands over a specified number of prices sampled
once every n bars. It calls array.push() and array.shift() to queue sourceInput values
through the sourceArray , then array.avg() and array.stdev() to compute the sampleMean and
sampleDev . The script then uses these values to calculate the highBand and lowBand ,
which it plots on the chart along with the sampleMean :
Let’s rewrite this code to utilize methods rather than built-in functions. In this version, we
have replaced all built-in array.* functions in the script with equivalent methods:
Note that:
We call the array methods using sourceArray.* rather than referencing the array
namespace.
We do not include sourceArray as a parameter when we call the methods since they
already reference the object.
User-defined methods
Pine Script™ allows users to define custom methods for use with objects of any built-in or
user-defined type. Defining a method is essentially the same as defining a function, but with
two key differences:
The method keyword must be included before the function name.
The type of the first parameter in the signature must be explicitly declared, as it
represents the type of object that the method will be associated with.
Let’s apply user-defined methods to our previous Bollinger Bands example to encapsulate
operations from the global scope, which will simplify the code and promote reusability. See
this portion from the example:
We will start by defining a simple method to queue values through an array in a single call.
This maintainQueue() method invokes the push() and shift() methods on a srcArray when
takeSample is true and returns the object:
Note that:
Just as with user-defined functions, we use the @function compiler annotation to
document method descriptions.
Now we can replace sourceArray.push() and sourceArray.shift() with
sourceArray.maintainQueue() in our example:
From here, we will further simplify our code by defining a method that handles all Bollinger
Band calculations within its scope.
This calcBB() method invokes the avg() and stdev() methods on a srcArray to update
mean and dev values when calculate is true. The method uses these values to return a
tuple containing the basis, upper band, and lower band values respectively:
With this method, we can now remove Bollinger Band calculations from the global scope and
improve code readability:
Note that:
Rather than using an if block in the global scope, we have defined a newSample
variable that is only true once every n bars. The maintainQueue() and calcBB()
methods use this value for their respective takeSample and calculate parameters.
Since the maintainQueue() method returns the object that it references, we’re able to
call calcBB() from the same line of code, as both methods apply to array<float>
instances.
Here is how the full script example looks now that we’ve applied our user-defined methods:
Method overloading
User-defined methods can override and overload existing built-in and user-defined methods
with the same identifier. This capability allows users to define multiple routines associated
with different parameter signatures under the same method name.
As a simple example, suppose we want to define a method to identify a variable’s type. Since
we must explicitly specify the type of object associated with a user-defined method, we will
need to define overloads for each type that we want it to recognize.
Below, we have defined a getType() method that returns a string representation of a
variable’s type with overloads for the five primitive types:
Now we can use these overloads to inspect some variables. This script uses str.format() to
format the results from calling the getType() method on five different variables into a single
results string, then displays the string in the lbl label using the built-in set_text() method:
Note that:
The underlying type of each variable determines which overload of getType() the
compiler will use.
The method will append “(na)” to the output string when a variable is na to demarcate
that it is empty.
Advanced example
Let’s apply what we’ve learned to construct a script that estimates the cumulative distribution
of elements in an array, meaning the fraction of elements in the array that are less than or
equal to any given value.
There are many ways in which we could choose to tackle this objective. For this example, we
will start by defining a method to replace elements of an array, which will help us count the
occurrences of elements within a range of values.
Written below is an overload of the built-in fill() method for array<float> instances. This
overload replaces elements in a srcArray within the range between the lowerBound and
upperBound with an innerValue , and replaces all elements outside the range with an
outerValue :
With this method, we can filter an array by value ranges to produce an array of occurrences.
For example, the expression:
copies the srcArray object, replaces all elements between min and val with 1.0, then
replaces all elements above val with 0.0. From here, it’s easy to estimate the output of the
cumulative distribution function at the val , as it’s simply the average of the resulting array:
Note that:
The compiler will only use this fill() overload instead of the built-in when the user
provides innerValue , outerValue , lowerBound , and upperBound arguments in the
call.
If either lowerBound or upperBound is na , its value is ignored while filtering the fill
range.
We are able to call copy() , fill() , and avg() successively on the same line of code
because the first two methods return an array<float> instance.
We can now use this to define a method that will calculate our empirical distribution values.
The following eCDF() method estimates a number of evenly spaced ascending steps from
the cumulative distribution function of a srcArray and pushes the results into a cdfArray :
Lastly, to ensure that our eCDF() method functions properly for arrays containing small and
large values, we will define a method to normalize our arrays.
This featureScale() method uses array min() and range() methods to produce a rescaled
copy of a srcArray . We will use this to normalize our arrays prior to invoking the eCDF()
method:
Note that:
This method does not include special handling for divide by zero conditions. If rng is 0,
the value of the array element will be na .
The full example below queues a sourceArray of size length with sourceInput values
using our previous maintainQueue() method, normalizes the array’s elements using the
featureScale() method, then calls the eCDF() method to get an array of estimates for n
evenly spaced steps on the distribution. The script then calls a user-defined makeLabel()
function to display the estimates and prices in a label on the right side of the chart:

Reading and writing array elements
Scripts can write values to existing individual array elements using array.set(id, index, value),
and read using array.get(id, index). When using these functions, it is imperative that the
index in the function call is always less than or equal to the array’s size (because array
indices start at zero). To get the size of an array, use the array.size(id) function.
The following example uses the set() method to populate a fillColors array with instances
of one base color using different transparency levels. It then uses array.get() to retrieve one of
the colors from the array based on the location of the bar with the highest price within the last
lookbackInput bars:
Another technique for initializing the elements in an array is to create an empty array (an array
with no elements), then use array.push() to append new elements to the end of the array,
increasing the size of the array by one on each call. The following code is functionally
identical to the initialization section from the preceding script:
This code is equivalent to the one above, but it uses array.unshift() to insert new elements at
the beginning of the fillColors array:
We can also use array.from() to create the same fillColors array with a single function call:
The array.fill(id, value, index_from, index_to) function points all array elements, or the
elements within the index_from to index_to range, to a specified value . Without the last
two optional parameters, the function fills the whole array, so:
and:
are equivalent, but:
only fills the second and third elements (at index 1 and 2) of the array with close . Note how
array.fill()‘s last parameter, index_to , must be one greater than the last index the function
will fill. The remaining elements will hold na values, as the array.new() function call does not
contain an initial_value argument.
Looping through array elements
When looping through an array’s element indices and the array’s size is unknown, one can use
the array.size() function to get the maximum index value. For example:
Note that:
We use the request.security_lower_tf() function which returns an array of close prices at
the 1 minute timeframe.
This code example will throw an error if you use it on a chart timeframe smaller than 1
minute .
for loops do not execute if the to expression is na. Note that the to value is only
evaluated once upon entry.
An alternative method to loop through an array is to use a for…in loop. This approach is a
variation of the standard for loop that can iterate over the value references and indices in an
array. Here is an example of how we can write the code example from above using a
for...in loop:
Note that:
for…in loops can return a tuple containing each index and corresponding element. For
example, for [i, price] in a returns the i index and price value for each element
in a .
A while loop statement can also be used:
Scope
Users can declare arrays within the global scope of a script, as well as the local scopes of
functions, methods, and conditional structures. Unlike some of the other built-in types,
namely fundamental types, scripts can modify globally-assigned arrays from within local
scopes, allowing users to implement global variables that any function in the script can
directly interact with. We use the functionality here to calculate progressively lower or higher
price levels:
History referencing
Pine Script™‘s history-referencing operator [ ] can access the history of array variables,
allowing scripts to interact with past array instances previously assigned to a variable.
To illustrate this, let’s create a simple example to show how one can fetch the previous bar’s
close value in two equivalent ways. This script uses the [ ] operator to get the array instance
assigned to a on the previous bar, then uses the get() method to retrieve the value of the
first element ( previousClose1 ). For previousClose2 , we use the history-referencing
operator on the close variable directly to retrieve the value. As we see from the plots,
previousClose1 and previousClose2 both return the same value:
Inserting and removing array elements
Inserting
The following three functions can insert new elements into an array.
array.unshift() inserts a new element at the beginning of an array (index 0) and increases the
index values of any existing elements by one.
array.insert() inserts a new element at the specified index and increases the index of
existing elements at or after the index by one.
array.push() adds a new element at the end of an array.
Removing
These four functions remove elements from an array. The first three also return the value of
the removed element.
array.remove() removes the element at the specified index and returns that element’s value.
array.shift() removes the first element from an array and returns its value.
array.pop() removes the last element of an array and returns its value.
array.clear() removes all elements from an array. Note that clearing an array won’t delete any
objects its elements referenced. See the example below that illustrates how this works:
Using an array as a stack
Stacks are LIFO (last in, first out) constructions. They behave somewhat like a vertical pile of
books to which books can only be added or removed one at a time, always from the top. Pine
Script™ arrays can be used as a stack, in which case we use the array.push() and array.pop()
functions to add and remove elements at the end of the array.
array.push(prices, close) will add a new element to the end of the prices array,
increasing the array’s size by one.
array.pop(prices) will remove the end element from the prices array, return its value and
decrease the array’s size by one.
See how the functions are used here to track successive lows in rallies:
Using an array as a queue
Queues are FIFO (first in, first out) constructions. They behave somewhat like cars arriving at
a red light. New cars are queued at the end of the line, and the first car to leave will be the
first one that arrived to the red light.
In the following code example, we let users decide through the script’s inputs how many
labels they want to have on their chart. We use that quantity to determine the size of the array
of labels we then create, initializing the array’s elements to na .
When a new pivot is detected, we create a label for it, saving the label’s ID in the pLabel
variable. We then queue the ID of that label by using array.push() to append the new label’s ID
to the end of the array, making our array size one greater than the maximum number of labels
to keep on the chart.
Lastly, we de-queue the oldest label by removing the array’s first element using array.shift()
and deleting the label referenced by that array element’s value. As we have now de-queued
an element from our queue, the array contains pivotCountInput elements once again. Note
that on the dataset’s first bars we will be deleting na label IDs until the maximum number of
labels has been created, but this does not cause runtime errors. Let’s look at our code:
Calculations on arrays
While series variables can be viewed as a horizontal set of values stretching back in time, Pine
Script™‘s one-dimensional arrays can be viewed as vertical structures residing on each bar.
As an array’s set of elements is not a time series, Pine Script™‘s usual mathematical functions
are not allowed on them. Special-purpose functions must be used to operate on all of an
array’s values. The available functions are: array.abs(), array.avg(), array.covariance(),
array.min(), array.max(), array.median(), array.mode(), array.percentile_linear_interpolation(),
array.percentile_nearest_rank(), array.percentrank(), array.range(), array.standardize(),
array.stdev(), array.sum(), array.variance().
Note that contrary to the usual mathematical functions in Pine Script™, those used on arrays
do not return na when some of the values they calculate on have na values. There are a few
exceptions to this rule:
When all array elements have na value or the array contains no elements, na is
returned. array.standardize() however, will return an empty array.
array.mode() will return na when no mode is found.
Manipulating arrays
Concatenation
Two arrays can be merged — or concatenated — using array.concat(). When arrays are
concatenated, the second array is appended to the end of the first, so the first array is
modified while the second one remains intact. The function returns the array ID of the first
array:
Copying
You can copy an array using array.copy(). Here we copy the array a to a new array named
_b :
Note that simply using _b = a in the previous example would not have copied the array, but
only its ID. From thereon, both variables would point to the same array, so using either one
would affect the same array.
Joining
Use array.join() to concatenate all of the elements in the array into a string and separate these
elements with the specified separator:
Sorting
Arrays containing “int” or “float” elements can be sorted in either ascending or descending
order using array.sort(). The order parameter is optional and defaults to order.ascending. As
all array.*() function arguments, it is qualified as “series”, so can be determined at runtime,
as is done here. Note that in the example, which array is sorted is also determined at runtime:
Another useful option for sorting arrays is to use the array.sort_indices() function, which takes
a reference to the original array and returns an array containing the indices from the original
array. Please note that this function won’t modify the original array. The order parameter is
optional and defaults to order.ascending.
Reversing
Use array.reverse() to reverse an array:
Slicing
Slicing an array using array.slice() creates a shallow copy of a subset of the parent array. You
determine the size of the subset to slice using the index_from and index_to parameters.
The index_to argument must be one greater than the end of the subset you want to slice.
The shallow copy created by the slice acts like a window on the parent array’s content. The
indices used for the slice define the window’s position and size over the parent array. If, as in
the example below, a slice is created from the first three elements of an array (indices 0 to 2),
then regardless of changes made to the parent array, and as long as it contains at least three
elements, the shallow copy will always contain the parent array’s first three elements.
Additionally, once the shallow copy is created, operations on the copy are mirrored on the
parent array. Adding an element to the end of the shallow copy, as is done in the following
example, will widen the window by one element and also insert that element in the parent
array at index 3. In this example, to slice the subset from index 0 to index 2 of array a , we
must use _sliceOfA = array.slice(a, 0, 3) :
Searching arrays
We can test if a value is part of an array with the array.includes() function, which returns true
if the element is found. We can find the first occurrence of a value in an array by using the
array.indexof() function. The first occurence is the one with the lowest index. We can also find
the last occurrence of a value with array.lastindexof():
We can also perform a binary search on an array but note that performing a binary search on
an array means that the array will first need to be sorted in ascending order only. The
array.binary_search() function will return the value’s index if it was found or -1 if it wasn’t. If
we want to always return an existing index from the array even if our chosen value wasn’t
found, then we can use one of the other binary search functions available. The
array.binary_search_leftmost() function, which returns an index if the value was found or the
first index to the left where the value would be found. The array.binary_search_rightmost()
function is almost identical and returns an index if the value was found or the first index to the
right where the value would be found.
Error handling
Malformed array.*() call syntax in Pine scripts will cause the usual compiler error
messages to appear in Pine Editor’s console, at the bottom of the window, when you save a
script. Refer to the Pine Script™ v6 Reference Manual when in doubt regarding the exact
syntax of function calls.
Scripts using arrays can also throw runtime errors, which appear as an exclamation mark next
to the indicator’s name on the chart. We discuss those runtime errors in this section.
Index xx is out of bounds. Array size is yy
This will most probably be the most frequent error you encounter. It will happen when you
reference an nonexistent array index. The “xx” value will be the value of the faulty index you
tried to use, and “yy” will be the size of the array. Recall that array indices start at zero — not
one — and end at the array’s size, minus one. An array of size 3’s last valid index is thus 2 .
To avoid this error, you must make provisions in your code logic to prevent using an index
lying outside of the array’s index boundaries. This code will generate the error because the
last index we use in the loop is outside the valid index range for the array:
The correct for statement is:
To loop on all array elements in an array of unknown size, use:
When you size arrays dynamically using a field in your script’s Settings/Inputs tab, protect the
boundaries of that value using input.int()‘s minval and maxval parameters:
See the Looping section of this page for more information.
Cannot call array methods when ID of array is ‘na’
When an array ID is initialized to na , operations on it are not allowed, since no array exists.
All that exists at that point is an array variable containing the na value rather that a valid
array ID pointing to an existing array. Note that an array created with no elements in it, as you
do when you use a = array.new_int(0) , has a valid ID nonetheless. This code will throw the
error we are discussing:
To avoid it, create an array with size zero using:
or:
Array is too large. Maximum size is 100000
This error will appear if your code attempts to declare an array with a size greater than
100,000. It will also occur if, while dynamically appending elements to an array, a new element
would increase the array’s size past the maximum.
Cannot create an array with a negative size
We haven’t found any use for arrays of negative size yet, but if you ever do, we may allow
them :)
Cannot use shift() if array is empty.
This error will occur if array.shift() is called to remove the first element of an empty array.
Cannot use pop() if array is empty.
This error will occur if array.pop() is called to remove the last element of an empty array.
Index ‘from’ should be less than index ‘to’
When two indices are used in functions such as array.slice(), the first index must always be
smaller than the second one.
Slice is out of bounds of the parent array
This message occurs whenever the parent array’s size is modified in such a way that it makes
the shallow copy created by a slice point outside the boundaries of the parent array. This
code will reproduce it because after creating a slice from index 3 to 4 (the last two elements
of our five-element parent array), we remove the parent’s first element, making its size four
and its last index 3. From that moment on, the shallow copy which is still poiting to the
“window” at the parent array’s indices 3 to 4, is pointing out of the parent array’s boundaries:

data, but they update their values for realtime bars (i.e., the bars since the script’s last
compilation) on each new price tick. Arrays assigned to varip variables can only hold

within their fields these types or collections (arrays, matrices) of these types.

User Manual / Language / Matrices ADVANCED Matrices Introduction Pine Script™ Matrices are collections that store value references in a rectangular format. They are the equivalent of two-dimensional array objects with functions and methods for inspection, modification, and specialized calculations. As with arrays, all matrix elements must be of the same type, user-defined type, or enum type. Matrices reference their elements using two indices: one index for their rows and the other for their columns. Each index starts at 0 and extends to the number of rows/columns in the matrix minus one. Matrices in Pine can have dynamic numbers of rows and columns that vary across bars. The total number of elements within a matrix is the product of the number of rows and columns (e.g., a 5x5 matrix has a total of 25). Like arrays, the total number of elements in a matrix cannot exceed 100,000. Declaring a matrix Pine Script™ uses the following syntax for matrix declaration: Where <type> is a type template for the matrix that declares the type of values it will contain, and the <expression> returns either a matrix instance of the type or na . When declaring a matrix variable as na , users must specify that the identifier will reference matrices of a specific type by including the matrix keyword followed by a type template. This line declares a new myMatrix variable with a value of na . It explicitly declares the variable as matrix<float> , which tells the compiler that the variable can only accept matrix objects containing float values: When a matrix variable is not assigned to na , the matrix keyword and its type template are optional, as the compiler will use the type information from the object the variable references. Here, we declare a myMatrix variable referencing a new matrix<float> instance with two rows, two columns, and an initial_value of 0. The variable gets its type information from the new object in this case, so it doesn’t require an explicit type declaration: Using `var` and `varip` keywords As with other variables, users can include the var or varip keywords to instruct a script to declare a matrix variable only once rather than on every bar. A matrix variable declared with this keyword will point to the same instance throughout the span of the chart unless the script explicitly assigns another matrix to it, allowing a matrix and its element references to persist between script iterations. This script declares an m variable assigned to a matrix that holds a single row of two int elements using the var keyword. On every 20th bar, the script adds 1 to the first element on the first row of the m matrix. The plot() call displays this element on the chart. As we see from the plot, the value of m.get(0, 0) persists between bars, never returning to the initial value of 0: Reading and writing matrix elements `matrix.get()` and `matrix.set()` To retrieve the value from a matrix at a specified row and column index, use matrix.get(). This function locates the specified matrix element and returns its value. Similarly, to overwrite a specific element’s value, use matrix.set() to assign the element at the specified row and column to a new value . The example below defines a square matrix m with two rows and columns and an initial_value of 0 for all elements on the first bar. The script adds 1 to each element’s value on different bars using the m.get() and m.set() methods. It updates the first row’s first value once every 11 bars, the first row’s second value once every seven bars, the second row’s first value once every five bars, and the second row’s second value once every three bars. The script plots each element’s value on the chart: `matrix.fill()` To overwrite all matrix elements with a specific value, use matrix.fill(). This function points all items in the entire matrix or within the from_row/column and to_row/column index range to the value specified in the call. For example, this snippet declares a 4x4 square matrix, then fills its elements with a random value: Note when using matrix.fill() with matrices containing special types (line, linefill, box, polyline, label, table, or chart.point) or UDTs, all replaced elements will point to the same object passed in the function call. This script declares a matrix with four rows and columns of label references, which it fills with a new label object on the first bar. On each bar, the script sets the x attribute of the label referenced at row 0, column 0 to bar_index, and the text attribute of the one referenced at row 3, column 3 to the number of labels on the chart. Although the matrix can reference 16 (4x4) labels, each element points to the same instance, resulting in only one label on the chart that updates its x and text attributes on each bar: Rows and columns Retrieving Matrices facilitate the retrieval of all values from a specific row or column via the matrix.row() and matrix.col() functions. These functions return the values as an array object sized according to the other dimension of the matrix, i.e., the size of a matrix.row() array equals the number of columns and the size of a matrix.col() array equals the number of rows. The script below populates a 3x2 m matrix with the values 1 - 6 on the first chart bar. It calls the m.row() and m.col() methods to access the first row and column arrays from the matrix and displays them on the chart in a label along with the array sizes:
Scripts can sort the contents of a matrix via matrix.sort(). Unlike array.sort(), which sorts
elements, this function organizes all rows in a matrix in a specified order (order.ascending
by default) based on the values in a specified column .
This script declares a 3x3 m matrix, sorts the rows of the m1 copy in ascending order based
on the first column, then sorts the rows of the m2 copy in descending order based on the
second column. It displays the original matrix and sorted copies in labels using our
debugLabel() method:
It’s important to note that matrix.sort() does not sort the columns of a matrix. However, one
can use this function to sort matrix columns with the help of matrix.transpose().
As an example, this script contains a sortColumns() method that uses the sort() method to
sort the transpose of a matrix using the column corresponding to the row of the original
matrix. The script uses this method to sort the m matrix based on the contents of its first
row:
Concatenating
Scripts can concatenate two matrices using matrix.concat(). This function appends the rows
of an id2 matrix to the end of an id1 matrix with the same number of columns.
To create a matrix with elements representing the columns of a matrix appended to another,
transpose both matrices, use matrix.concat() on the transposed matrices, then transpose()
the result.
For example, this script appends the rows of the m2 matrix to the m1 matrix and appends
their columns using transposed copies of the matrices. It displays the m1 and m2 matrices
and the results after concatenating their rows and columns in labels using the custom
debugLabel() method:
Matrix calculations
Element-wise calculations
Pine scripts can calculate the average, minimum, maximum, and mode of all elements within a
matrix via matrix.avg(), matrix.min(), matrix.max(), and matrix.mode(). These functions
operate the same as their array.* equivalents, allowing users to run element-wise
calculations on a matrix, its submatrices, and its rows and columns using the same syntax. For
example, the built-in *.avg() functions called on a 3x3 matrix with values 1-9 and an array
with the same nine elements will both return a value of 5.
The script below uses *.avg() , *.max() , and *.min() methods to calculate developing
averages and extremes of OHLC data in a period. It adds a new column of open, high, low, and
close values to the end of the ohlcData matrix whenever queueColumn is true . When
false , the script uses the get() and set() matrix methods to adjust the elements in the last
column for developing HLC values in the current period. It uses the ohlcData matrix, a
submatrix(), and row() and col() arrays to calculate the developing OHLC4 and HL2 averages
over length periods, the maximum high and minimum low over length periods, and the
current period’s developing OHLC4 price:
Note that:
In this example, we used array.*() and matrix.*() methods interchangeably to
demonstrate their similarities in syntax and behavior.
Users can calculate the matrix equivalent of array.sum() by multiplying the matrix.avg()
by the matrix.elements_count().
Special calculations
Pine Script™ features several built-in functions for performing essential matrix arithmetic and
linear algebra operations, including matrix.sum(), matrix.diff(), matrix.mult(), matrix.pow(),
matrix.det(), matrix.inv(), matrix.pinv(), matrix.rank(), matrix.trace(), matrix.eigenvalues(),
matrix.eigenvectors(), and matrix.kron(). These functions are advanced features that facilitate
a variety of matrix calculations and transformations.
Below, we explain a few fundamental functions with some basic examples.
`matrix.sum()` and `matrix.diff()`
Scripts can perform addition and subtraction of two matrices with the same shape or a matrix
and a scalar value using the matrix.sum() and matrix.diff() functions. These functions use the
values from the id2 matrix or scalar to add to or subtract from the elements in id1 .
This script demonstrates a simple example of matrix addition and subtraction in Pine. It
creates a 3x3 matrix, calculates its transpose, then calculates the matrix.sum() and
matrix.diff() of the two matrices. This example displays the original matrix, its transpose, and
the resulting sum and difference matrices in labels on the chart:
Note that:
In this example, we’ve labeled the original matrix as “A” and the transpose as “Aᵀ”.
Adding “A” and “Aᵀ” produces a symmetric matrix, and subtracting them produces an
antisymmetric matrix.
`matrix.mult()`
Scripts can multiply two matrices via the matrix.mult() function. This function also facilitates
the multiplication of a matrix by an array or a scalar value.
In the case of multiplying two matrices, unlike addition and subtraction, matrix multiplication
does not require two matrices to share the same shape. However, the number of columns in
the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second one. The resulting matrix
returned by matrix.mult() will contain the same number of rows as id1 and the same number
of columns as id2 . For instance, a 2x3 matrix multiplied by a 3x4 matrix will produce a
matrix with two rows and four columns, as shown below. Each value within the resulting matrix
is the dot product of the corresponding row in id1 and column in id2 :
Note that:
In contrast to the multiplication of scalars, matrix multiplication is non-commutative, i.e.,
matrix.mult(a, b) does not necessarily produce the same result as matrix.mult(b,
a) . In the context of our example, the latter will raise a runtime error because the
number of columns in b doesn’t equal the number of rows in a .
When multiplying a matrix and an array, this function treats the operation the same as
multiplying id1 by a single-column matrix, but it returns an array with the same number of
elements as the number of rows in id1 . When matrix.mult() passes a scalar as its id2 value,
the function returns a new matrix whose elements are the elements in id1 multiplied by the
id2 value.
`matrix.det()`
A determinant is a scalar value associated with a square matrix that describes some of its
characteristics, namely its invertibility. If a matrix has an inverse, its determinant is nonzero.
Otherwise, the matrix is singular (non-invertible). Scripts can calculate the determinant of a
matrix via matrix.det().
Programmers can use determinants to detect similarities between matrices, identify full-rank
and rank-deficient matrices, and solve systems of linear equations, among other applications.
For example, this script utilizes determinants to solve a system of linear equations with a
matching number of unknown values using Cramer’s rule. The user-defined solve() function
returns an array containing solutions for each unknown value in the system, where the n-th
element of the array is the determinant of the coefficient matrix with the n-th column replaced
by the column of constants divided by the determinant of the original coefficients.
In this script, we’ve defined the matrix m that holds coefficients and constants for these
three equations:
The solution to this system is (x0 = 1, x1 = 2, x2 = 3) . The script calculates these values
from m via m.solve() and plots them on the chart:
Note that:
Solving systems of equations is particularly useful for regression analysis, e.g., linear
and polynomial regression.
Cramer’s rule works fine for small systems of equations. However, it’s computationally
inefficient on larger systems. Other methods, such as Gaussian elimination, are often
preferred for such use cases.
`matrix.inv()` and `matrix.pinv()`
For any non-singular square matrix, there is an inverse matrix that yields the identity matrix
when multiplied by the original. Inverses have utility in various matrix transformations and
solving systems of equations. Scripts can calculate the inverse of a matrix when one exists
via the matrix.inv() function.
For singular (non-invertible) matrices, one can calculate a generalized inverse
(pseudoinverse), regardless of whether the matrix is square or has a nonzero determinant
<_PageMatrices_MatrixCalculations_SpecialCalculations_MatrixDet> , via the matrix.pinv()
function. Keep in mind that unlike a true inverse, the product of a pseudoinverse and the
original matrix does not necessarily equal the identity matrix unless the original matrix is
invertible.
The following example forms a 2x2 m matrix from user inputs, then uses the m.inv() and
m.pinv() methods to calculate the inverse or pseudoinverse of m . The script displays the
original matrix, its inverse or pseudoinverse, and their product in labels on the chart:
Note that:
This script will only call m.inv() when isInvertible is true , i.e., when m is square and
has a nonzero determinant. Otherwise, it uses m.pinv() to calculate the generalized
inverse.
`matrix.rank()`
The rank of a matrix represents the number of linearly independent vectors (rows or columns)
it contains. In essence, matrix rank measures the number of vectors one cannot express as a
linear combination of others, or in other words, the number of vectors that contain unique
information. Scripts can calculate the rank of a matrix via matrix.rank().
This script identifies the number of linearly independent vectors in two 3x3 matrices ( m1 and
m2 ) and plots the values in a separate pane. As we see on the chart, the m1.rank() value is 3
because each vector is unique. The m2.rank() value, on the other hand, is 1 because it has
just one unique vector:
Note that:
The highest rank value a matrix can have is the minimum of its number of rows and
columns. A matrix with the maximum possible rank is known as a full-rank matrix, and
any matrix without full rank is known as a rank-deficient matrix.
The determinants of full-rank square matrices are nonzero, and such matrices have
inverses. Conversely, the determinant of a rank-deficient matrix is always 0.
For any matrix that contains nothing but the same value in each of its elements (e.g., a
matrix filled with 0), the rank is always 0 since none of the vectors hold unique
information. For any other matrix with distinct values, the minimum possible rank is 1.
Error handling
In addition to usual compiler errors, which occur during a script’s compilation due to
improper syntax, scripts using matrices can raise specific runtime errors during their
execution. When a script raises a runtime error, it displays a red exclamation point next to the
script title. Users can view the error message by clicking this icon.
In this section, we discuss runtime errors that users may encounter while utilizing matrices in
their scripts.
The row/column index (xx) is out of bounds, row/column size
is (yy).
This runtime error occurs when trying to access indices outside the matrix dimensions with
functions including matrix.get(), matrix.set(), matrix.fill(), and matrix.submatrix(), as well as
some of the functions relating to the rows and columns of a matrix.
For example, this code contains two lines that will produce this runtime error. The m.set()
method references a row index that doesn’t exist (2). The m.submatrix() method references
all column indices up to to_column - 1 . A to_column value of 4 results in a runtime error
because the last column index referenced (3) does not exist in m :
Users can avoid this error in their scripts by ensuring their function calls do not reference
indices greater than or equal to the number of rows/columns.
The array size does not match the number of rows/columns
in the matrix.
When using matrix.add_row() and matrix.add_col() functions to insert rows and columns into
a non-empty matrix, the size of the inserted array must align with the matrix dimensions. The
size of an inserted row must match the number of columns, and the size of an inserted
column must match the number of rows. Otherwise, the script will raise this runtime error. For
example:
Note that:
When m is empty, one can insert a row or column array of any size, as shown in the first
m.add_col() line.
Cannot call matrix methods when the ID of matrix is ‘na’.
When a matrix variable is assigned to na , it means that the variable doesn’t reference an
existing object. Consequently, one cannot use built-in matrix.*() functions and methods
with it. For example:
To resolve this error, assign m to a valid matrix instance before using matrix.*() functions.
Matrix is too large. Maximum size of the matrix is 100,000
elements.
The total number of elements in a matrix (matrix.elements_count()) cannot exceed 100,000,
regardless of its shape. For example, this script will raise an error because it inserts 1000
rows with 101 elements into the m matrix:
The row/column index must be 0 <= from_row/column <
to_row/column.
When using matrix.*() functions with from_row/column and to_row/column indices, the
from_* values must be less than the corresponding to_* values, with the minimum possible
value being 0. Otherwise, the script will raise a runtime error.
For example, this script shows an attempt to declare a submatrix from a 4x4 m matrix with a
from_row value of 2 and a to_row value of 2, which will result in an error:
Matrices ‘id1’ and ‘id2’ must have an equal number of rows
and columns to be added.
When using matrix.sum() and matrix.diff() functions, the id1 and id2 matrices must have
the same number of rows and the same number of columns. Attempting to add or subtract
two matrices with mismatched dimensions will raise an error, as demonstrated by this code:
The number of columns in the ‘id1’ matrix must equal the
number of rows in the matrix (or the number of elements in
the array) ‘id2’.
When using matrix.mult() to multiply an id1 matrix by an id2 matrix or array, the
matrix.rows() or array.size() of id2 must equal the matrix.columns() in id1 . If they don’t
align, the script will raise this error.
For example, this script tries to multiply two 2x3 matrices. While adding these matrices is
possible, multiplying them is not:
Operation not available for non-square matrices.
Some matrix operations, including matrix.inv(), matrix.det(), matrix.eigenvalues(), and
matrix.eigenvectors() only work with square matrices, i.e., matrices with the same number of
rows and columns. When attempting to execute such functions on non-square matrices, the
script will raise an error stating the operation isn’t available or that it cannot calculate the
result for the matrix id . For example:

Note that:
This script replaces the values associated with the “Rising”, “Falling”, and “Difference”
keys on successive data.put() calls, as each of these keys is unique and can only appear
once in the data map.
Replacing the pairs in a map does not change the internal insertion order of its keys. We
discuss this further in the next section.
Similar to working with other collections, when putting a value of a special type (line, linefill,
box, polyline, label, table, or chart.point) or a user-defined type into a map, it’s important to
note the inserted pair’s value points to that same object without copying it. Modifying the
value referenced by a key-value pair will also affect the original object.
For example, this script contains a custom ChartData type with o , h , l , and c fields. On
the first chart bar, the script declares a myMap variable and adds the pair ("A", myData) ,
where myData is a ChartData instance with initial field values of na . It adds the pair ("B",
myData) to myMap and updates the object from this pair on every bar via the user-defined
update() method.
Each change to the object with the “B” key affects the one referenced by the “A” key, as
shown by the candle plot of the “A” object’s fields:
Note that:
This script would behave differently if it passed a copy of myData into each
myMap.put() call. For more information, see this section of our User Manual’s page on
objects.
Inspecting keys and values
`map.keys()` and `map.values()`
To retrieve all keys and values put into a map, use map.keys() and map.values(). These
functions copy all key/value references within a map id to a new array object. Modifying the
array returned from either of these functions does not affect the id map.
Although maps are unordered collections, Pine Script™ internally maintains the insertion
order of a map’s key-value pairs. As a result, the map.keys() and map.values() functions
always return arrays with their elements ordered based on the id map’s insertion order.
The script below demonstrates this by displaying the key and value arrays from an m map in
a label once every 50 bars. As we see on the chart, the order of elements in each array
returned by m.keys() and m.values() aligns with the insertion order of the key-value pairs
in m :
Note that:
The value with the “First” key is a random whole number between 0 and 100. The
“Second” value is one greater than the “First”, and the “Third” value is one greater than
the “Second”.
It’s important to note a map’s internal insertion order does not change when replacing its
key-value pairs. The locations of the new elements in the keys() and values() arrays will be the
same as the old elements in such cases. The only exception is if the script completely
removes the key beforehand.
Below, we’ve added a line of code to put a new value with the “Second” key into the m map,
overwriting the previous value associated with that key. Although the script puts this new pair
into the map after the one with the “Third” key, the pair’s key and value are still second in the
keys and values arrays since the key was already present in m before the change:
`map.contains()`
To check if a specific key exists within a map id , use map.contains(). This function is a
convenient alternative to calling array.includes() on the array returned from map.keys().
For example, this script checks if various keys exist within an m map, then displays the
results in a label:
Removing key-value pairs
To remove a specific key-value pair from a map id , use map.remove(). This function
removes the key and its associated value from the map while preserving the insertion order
of other key-value pairs. It returns the removed value if the map contained the key .
Otherwise, it returns na.
To remove all key-value pairs from a map id at once, use map.clear().
The following script creates a new m map, puts key-value pairs into the map, uses
m.remove() within a loop to remove each valid key listed in the removeKeys array, then calls
m.clear() to remove all remaining key-value pairs. It uses a custom debugLabel() method to
display the size, keys, and values of m after each change:
Note that:
Not all strings in the removeKeys array were present in the keys of m . Attempting to
remove non-existent keys (“F”, “a”, and the second “B” in this example) has no effect on
a map’s contents.
Combining maps
Scripts can combine two maps via map.put_all(). This function puts all key-value pairs from
the id2 map, in their insertion order, into the id1 map. As with map.put(), if any keys in
id2 are also present in id1 , this function replaces the key-value pairs that contain those
keys without affecting their initial insertion order.
This example contains a user-defined hexMap() function that maps decimal int keys to string
representations of their hexadecimal forms. The script uses this function to create two maps,
mapA and mapB , then uses mapA.put_all(mapB) to put all key-value pairs from mapB into
mapA .
The script uses a custom debugLabel() function to display labels showing the keys and
values of mapA and mapB , then another label displaying the contents of mapA after putting
all key-value pairs from mapB into it:
Looping through a map
There are several ways scripts can iteratively access the keys and values in a map. For
example, one could loop through a map’s keys() array and get() the value for each key , like
so:
However, we recommend using a for...in loop directly on a map, as it iterates over the
map’s key-value pairs in their insertion order, returning a tuple containing the next pair’s key
and value on each iteration.
For example, this line of code loops through each key and value in thisMap , starting from
the first key-value pair put into it:
Let’s use this structure to write a script that displays a map’s key-value pairs in a table. In the
example below, we’ve defined a custom toTable() method that creates a table, then uses a
for...in loop to iterate over the map’s key-value pairs and populate the table’s cells. The
script uses this method to visualize a map containing length -bar averages of price and
volume data:
Copying a map
Shallow copies
Scripts can make a shallow copy of a map id using the map.copy() function. Modifications to
a shallow copy do not affect the original id map or its internal insertion order.
For example, this script constructs an m map with the keys “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D” assigned to
four random values between 0 and 10. It then creates an mCopy map as a shallow copy of m
and updates the values associated with its keys. The script displays the key-value pairs in m
and mCopy on the chart using our custom debugLabel() method:
Deep copies
While a shallow copy will suffice when copying maps that have values of a fundamental type
or enum type, it’s crucial to understand that shallow copies of a map holding values of a
special type (line, linefill, box, polyline, label, table, chart.point or a UDT) point to the same
objects as the original. Modifying the objects referenced by a shallow copy will affect the
instances referenced by the original map and vice versa.
To ensure changes to objects referenced by a copied map do not affect instances referenced
in other locations, one can make a deep copy by creating a new map with key-value pairs
containing copies of each value in the original map.
This example creates an original map of string keys and label values and puts a key-value
pair into it. The script copies the map to a shallow variable via the built-in copy() method,
then to a deep variable using a custom deepCopy() method.
As we see from the chart, changes to the label retrieved from the shallow copy also affect
the instance referenced by the original map, but changes to the one from the deep copy
do not:
Note that:
The deepCopy() method loops through the original map, copying each value and
putting key-value pairs containing the copies into a new map instance.
Scope and history
As with other collections in Pine, map variables leave historical trails on each bar, allowing a
script to access past map instances assigned to a variable using the history-referencing
operator []. Scripts can also assign maps to global variables and interact with them from the
scopes of functions, methods, and conditional structures.
As an example, this script uses a global map and its history to calculate an aggregate set of
EMAs. It declares a globalData map of int keys and float values, where each key in the map
corresponds to the length of each EMA calculation. The user-defined update() function
calculates each key -length EMA by mixing the values from the previous map assigned to
globalData with the current source value.
The script plots the maximum and minimum values in the global map’s values() array and the
value from globalData.get(50) (i.e., the 50-bar EMA):
Maps of other collections
Maps cannot directly use other maps, arrays, or matrices as values, but they can hold values
of a user-defined type that contains collections within its fields.
For example, suppose we want to create a “2D” map that uses string keys to access nested
maps that hold pairs of string keys and float values. Since maps cannot use other collections
as values, we will first create a wrapper type with a field to hold a map<string, float>
instance, like so:
With our Wrapper type defined, we can create maps of string keys and Wrapper values,
where the data field of each value in the map points to a map<string, float> instance:
The script below uses this concept to construct a map containing maps that hold OHLCV data
requested from multiple tickers. The user-defined requestData() function requests price and
volume data from a ticker, creates a <string, float> map, puts the data into it, then returns
a Wrapper instance containing the new map.
The script puts the results from each call to requestData() into the mapOfMaps , then creates
a string representation of the nested maps with a user-defined toString() method, which it
displays on the chart in a label:

Notice! The elements in a map.values() array point to the same values as the map
id . Consequently, when the map’s values are of reference types, including line,
linefill, box, polyline, label, table, chart.point, or UDTs, modifying the instances
referenced by the map.values() array will also affect those referenced by the map id
since the contents of both collections point to identical objects.

User Manual / Concepts / Alerts
Alerts
Introduction
TradingView alerts run 24x7 on our servers and do not require users to be logged in to
execute. Alerts are created from the charts user interface (UI). You will find all the information
necessary to understand how alerts work and how to create them from the charts UI in the
Help Center’s About TradingView alerts page.
Some of the alert types available on TradingView (generic alerts, drawing alerts and script
alerts on order fill events) are created from symbols or scripts loaded on the chart and do not
require specific coding. Any user can create these types of alerts from the charts UI.
Other types of alerts (script alerts triggering on alert() function calls, and alertcondition()
alerts) require specific Pine Script™ code to be present in a script to create an alert event
before script users can create alerts from them using the charts UI. Additionally, while script
users can create script alerts triggering on order fill events from the charts UI on any strategy
loaded on their chart, Programmers can specify explicit order fill alert messages in their script
for each type of order filled by the broker emulator.
This page covers the different ways Pine Script™ programmers can code their scripts to
create alert events from which script users will in turn be able to create alerts from the charts
UI. We will cover:
How to use the alert() function to alert() function calls in indicators or strategies, which
can then be included in script alerts created from the charts UI.
How to add custom alert messages to be included in script alerts triggering on the order
fill events of strategies.
How to use the alertcondition() function to generate, in indicators only, alertcondition()
events which can then be used to create alertcondition() alerts from the charts UI.
Keep in mind that:
No alert-related Pine Script™ code can create a running alert in the charts UI; it merely
creates alert events which can then be used by script users to create running alerts from
the charts UI.
Alerts only trigger in the realtime bar. The operational scope of Pine Script™ code
dealing with any type of alert is therefore restricted to realtime bars only.
When an alert is created in the charts UI, TradingView saves a mirror image of the script
and its inputs, along with the chart’s main symbol and timeframe to run the alert on its
servers. Subsequent changes to your script’s inputs or the chart will thus not affect
running alerts previously created from them. If you want any changes to your context to
be reflected in a running alert’s behavior, you will need to delete the alert and create a
new one in the new context.
Background
The different methods Pine programmers can use today to create alert events in their script
are the result of successive enhancements deployed throughout Pine Script™‘s evolution. The
alertcondition() function, which works in indicators only, was the first feature allowing Pine
Script™ programmers to create alert events. Then came order fill alerts for strategies, which
trigger when the broker emulator creates order fill events. Order fill events require no special
code for script users to create alerts on them, but by way of the alert_message parameter
for order-generating strategy.*() functions, programmers can customize the message of
alerts triggering on order fill events by defining a distinct alert message for any number of
order fulfillment events.
The alert() function is the most recent addition to Pine Script™. It more or less supersedes
alertcondition(), and when used in strategies, provides a useful complement to alerts on order
fill events.
Which type of alert is best?
For Pine Script™ programmers, the alert() function will generally be easier and more flexible
to work with. Contrary to alertcondition(), it allows for dynamic alert messages, works in both
indicators and strategies and the programmer decides on the frequency of alert() events.
While alert() calls can be generated on any logic programmable in Pine, including when orders
are sent to the broker emulator in strategies, they cannot be coded to trigger when orders are
executed (or filled) because after orders are sent to the broker emulator, the emulator
controls their execution and does not report fill events back to the script directly.
When a script user wants to generate an alert on a strategy’s order fill events, he must include
those events when creating a script alert on the strategy in the “Create Alert” dialog box. No
special code is required in scripts for users to be able to do this. The message sent with order
fill events can, however, be customized by programmers through use of the alert_message
parameter in order-generating strategy.*() function calls. A combination of alert() calls and
the use of custom alert_message arguments in order-generating strategy.*() calls should
allow programmers to generate alert events on most conditions occurring in their script’s
execution.
The alertcondition() function remains in Pine Script™ for backward compatibility, but it can
also be used advantageously to generate distinct alerts available for selection as individual
items in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s “Condition” field.
Script alerts
When a script user creates a script alert using the “Create Alert” dialog box, the events able
to trigger the alert will vary depending on whether the alert is created from an indicator or a
strategy.
A script alert created from an indicator will trigger when:
The indicator contains alert() calls.
The code’s logic allows a specific alert() call to execute.
The frequency specified in the alert() call allows the alert to trigger.
A script alert created from a strategy can trigger on alert() function calls, on order fill events,
or both. The script user creating an alert on a strategy decides which type of events he
wishes to include in his script alert. While users can create a script alert on order fill events
without the need for a strategy to include special code, it must contain alert() calls for users
to include alert() function calls in their script alert.
`alert()` function events
The alert() function has the following signature:
message
A “series string” representing the message text sent when the alert triggers. Because this
argument allows “series” values, it can be generated at runtime and differ bar to bar, making it
dynamic.
freq
An “input string” specifying the triggering frequency of the alert. Valid arguments are:
alert.freq_once_per_bar : Only the first call per realtime bar triggers the alert (default
value).
alert.freq_once_per_bar_close : An alert is only triggered when the realtime bar closes
and an alert() call is executed during that script iteration.
alert.freq_all : All calls during the realtime bar trigger the alert.
The alert() function can be used in both indicators and strategies. For an alert() call to trigger
a script alert configured on alert() function calls, the script’s logic must allow the alert() call to
execute, and the frequency determined by the freq parameter must allow the alert to
trigger.
Note that by default, strategies are recalculated at the bar’s close, so if the alert() function
with the frequency alert.freq_all or alert.freq_once_per_bar is used in a strategy, then it
will be called no more often than once at the bar’s close. In order to enable the alert() function
to be called during the bar construction process, you need to enable the calc_on_every_tick
option.
Using all `alert()` calls
Let’s look at an example where we detect crosses of the RSI centerline:
If a script alert is created from this script:
When RSI crosses the centerline up, the script alert will trigger with the “Go long…”
message. When RSI crosses the centerline down, the script alert will trigger with the “Go
short…” message.
Because no argument is specified for the freq parameter in the alert() call, the default
value of alert.freq_once_per_bar will be used, so the alert will only trigger the first
time each of the alert() calls is executed during the realtime bar.
The message sent with the alert is composed of two parts: a constant string and then
the result of the str.tostring() call which will include the value of RSI at the moment
where the alert() call is executed by the script. An alert message for a cross up would
look like: “Go long (RSI is 53.41)“.
Because a script alert always triggers on any occurrence of a call to alert(), as long as
the frequency used in the call allows for it, this particular script does not allow a script
user to restrict his script alert to longs only, for example.
Note that:
Contrary to an alertcondition() call which is always placed at column 0 (in the script’s
global scope), the alert() call is placed in the local scope of an if branch so it only
executes when our triggering condition is met. If an alert() call was placed in the script’s
global scope at column 0, it would execute on all bars, which would likely not be the
desired behavior.
An alertcondition() could not accept the same string we use for our alert’s message
because of its use of the str.tostring() call. alertcondition() messages must be constant
strings.
Lastly, because alert() messages can be constructed dynamically at runtime, we could have
used the following code to generate our alert events:
Using selective `alert()` calls
When users create a script alert on alert() function calls, the alert will trigger on any call the
script makes to the alert() function, provided its frequency constraints are met. If you want to
allow your script’s users to select which alert() function call in your script will trigger a script
alert, you will need to provide them with the means to indicate their preference in your script’s
inputs, and code the appropriate logic in your script. This way, script users will be able to
create multiple script alerts from a single script, each behaving differently as per the choices
made in the script’s inputs prior to creating the alert in the charts UI.
Suppose, for our next example, that we want to provide the option of triggering alerts on only
longs, only shorts, or both. You could code your script like this:
Note how:
We create a compound condition that is met only when the user’s selection allows for an
entry in that direction. A long entry on a crossover of the centerline only triggers the
alert when long entries have been enabled in the script’s Inputs.
We offer the user to indicate his repainting preference. When he does not allow the
calculations to repaint, we wait until the bar’s confirmation to trigger the compound
condition. This way, the alert and the marker only appear at the end of the realtime bar.
If a user of this script wanted to create two distinct script alerts from this script, i.e., one
triggering only on longs, and one only on shorts, then he would need to:
Select only “Detect Longs” in the inputs and create a first script alert on the script.
Select only “Detect Shorts” in the Inputs and create another script alert on the
script.
In strategies
alert() function calls can be used in strategies also, with the provision that strategies, by
default, only execute on the close of realtime bars. Unless calc_on_every_tick = true is
used in the strategy() declaration statement, all alert() calls will use the
alert.freq_once_per_bar_close frequency, regardless of the argument used for freq .
While script alerts on strategies will use order fill events to trigger alerts when the broker
emulator fills orders, alert() can be used advantageously to generate other alert events in
strategies.
This strategy creates alert() function calls when RSI moves against the trade for three
consecutive bars:
If a user created a script alert from this strategy and included both order fill events and alert()
function calls in his alert, the alert would trigger whenever an order is executed, or when one
of the alert() calls was executed by the script on the realtime bar’s closing iteration, i.e., when
barstate.isrealtime and barstate.isconfirmed are both true. The alert() function events in the
script would only trigger the alert when the realtime bar closes because
alert.freq_once_per_bar_close is the argument used for the freq parameter in the alert()
calls.
Order fill events
When a script alert is created from an indicator, it can only trigger on alert() function calls.
However, when a script alert is created from a strategy, the user can specify that order fill
events also trigger the script alert. An order fill event is any event generated by the broker
emulator which causes a simulated order to be executed. It is the equivalent of a trade order
being filled by a broker/exchange. Orders are not necessarily executed when they are placed.
In a strategy, the execution of orders can only be detected indirectly and after the fact, by
analyzing changes in built-in variables such as strategy.opentrades or strategy.position_size.
Script alerts configured on order fill events are thus useful in that they allow the triggering of
alerts at the precise moment of an order’s execution, before a script’s logic can detect it.
Pine Script™ programmers can customize the alert message sent when specific orders are
executed. While this is not a pre-requisite for order fill events to trigger, custom alert
messages can be useful because they allow custom syntax to be included with alerts in order
to route actual orders to a third-party execution engine, for example. Specifying custom alert
messages for specific order fill events is done by means of the alert_message parameter in
functions which can generate orders: strategy.close(), strategy.entry(), strategy.exit() and
strategy.order().
The argument used for the alert_message parameter is a “series string”, so it can be
constructed dynamically using any variable available to the script, as long as it is converted to
string format.
Let’s look at a strategy where we use the alert_message parameter in both our
strategy.entry() calls:
Note that:
We use the stop parameter in our strategy.entry() calls, which creates stop-buy and
stop-sell orders. This entails that buy orders will only execute once price is higher than
the high on the bar where the order is placed, and sell orders will only execute once
price is lower than the [low] on the bar where the order is placed.
The up/down arrows which we plot with plotchar() are plotted when orders are placed.
Any number of bars may elapse before the order is actually executed, and in some cases
the order will never be executed because price does not meet the required condition.
Because we use the same id argument for all buy orders, any new buy order placed
before a previous order’s condition is met will replace that order. The same applies to
sell orders.
Variables included in the alert_message argument are evaluated when the order is
executed, so when the alert triggers.
When the alert_message parameter is used in a strategy’s order-generating strategy.*()
function calls, script users must include the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder
in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s “Message” field when creating script alerts on order fill
events. This is required so the alert_message argument used in the order-generating
strategy.*() function calls is used in the message of alerts triggering on each order fill
event. When only using the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in the
“Message” field and the alert_message parameter is present in only some of the ordergenerating
strategy.*() function calls in your strategy, an empty string will replace the
placeholder in the message of alerts triggered by any order-generating strategy.*()
function call not using the alert_message parameter.
While other placeholders can be used in the “Create Alert” dialog box’s “Message” field by
users creating alerts on order fill events, they cannot be used in the argument of
alert_message .
`alertcondition()` events
The alertcondition() function allows programmers to create individual alertcondition events in
their indicators. One indicator may contain more than one alertcondition() call. Each call to
alertcondition() in a script will create a corresponding alert selectable in the “Condition”
dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box.
While the presence of alertcondition() calls in a strategy script will not cause a compilation
error, alerts cannot be created from them.
The alertcondition() function has the following signature:
condition
A “series bool” value ( true or false ) which determines when the alert will trigger. It is a
required argument. When the value is true the alert will trigger. When the value is false
the alert will not trigger. Contrary to alert() function calls, alertcondition() calls must start at
column zero of a line, so cannot be placed in conditional blocks.
title
A “const string” optional argument that sets the name of the alert condition as it will appear in
the “Create Alert” dialog box’s “Condition” field in the charts UI. If no argument is supplied,
“Alert” will be used.
message
A “const string” optional argument that specifies the text message to display when the alert
triggers. The text will appear in the “Message” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box, from
where script users can then modify it when creating an alert. As this argument must be a
“const string”, it must be known at compilation time and thus cannot vary bar to bar. It
can, however, contain placeholders which will be replaced at runtime by dynamic values that
may change bar to bar. See this page’s Placeholders section for a list.
The alertcondition() function does not include a freq parameter. The frequency of
alertcondition() alerts is determined by users in the “Create Alert” dialog box.
Using one condition
Here is an example of code creating alertcondition() events:
Because we have two alertcondition() calls in our script, two different alerts will be available in
the “Create Alert” dialog box’s “Condition” field: “Long Alert” and “Short Alert”.
If we wanted to include the value of RSI when the cross occurs, we could not simply add its
value to the message string using str.tostring(r) , as we could in an alert() call or in an
alert_message argument in a strategy. We can, however, include it using a placeholder. This
shows two alternatives:
Note that:
The first line uses the {{plot_0}} placeholder, where the plot number corresponds to
the order of the plot in the script.
The second line uses the {{plot("[plot_title]")}} type of placeholder, which must
include the title of the plot() call used in our script to plot RSI. Double quotes are
used to wrap the plot’s title inside the {{plot("RSI")}} placeholder. This requires that
we use single quotes to wrap the message string.
Using one of these methods, we can include any numeric value that is plotted by our
indicator, but as strings cannot be plotted, no string variable can be used.
Using compound conditions
If we want to offer script users the possiblity of creating a single alert from an indicator using
multiple alertcondition() calls, we will need to provide options in the script’s inputs through
which users will indicate the conditions they want to trigger their alert before creating it.
This script demonstrates one way to do it:
Note how the alertcondition() call is allowed to trigger on one of two conditions. Each
condition can only trigger the alert if the user enables it in the script’s inputs before creating
the alert.
Placeholders
These placeholders can be used in the message argument of alertcondition() calls. They will
be replaced with dynamic values when the alert triggers. They are the only way to include
dynamic values (values that can vary bar to bar) in alertcondition() messages.
Note that users creating alertcondition() alerts from the “Create Alert” dialog box in the charts
UI are also able to use these placeholders in the dialog box’s “Message” field.
{{exchange}}
Exchange of the symbol used in the alert (NASDAQ, NYSE, MOEX, etc.). Note that for delayed
symbols, the exchange will end with “_DL” or “_DLY.” For example, “NYMEX_DL.”
{{interval}}
Returns the timeframe of the chart the alert is created on. Note that Range charts are
calculated based on 1m data, so the placeholder will always return “1” on any alert created on
a Range chart.
{{open}} , {{high}} , {{low}} , {{close}} , {{volume}}
Corresponding values of the bar on which the alert has been triggered.
{{plot_0}} , {{plot_1}} , […], {{plot_19}}
Value of the corresponding plot number. Plots are numbered from zero to 19 in order of
appearance in the script, so only one of the first 20 plots can be used. For example, the builtin
“Volume” indicator has two output series: Volume and Volume MA, so you could use the
following:
{{plot("[plot_title]")}}
This placeholder can be used when one needs to refer to a plot using the title argument
used in a plot() call. Note that double quotation marks ( " ) must be used inside the
placeholder to wrap the title argument. This requires that a single quotation mark ( ' ) be
used to wrap the message string:
{{ticker}}
Ticker of the symbol used in the alert (AAPL, BTCUSD, etc.).
{{time}}
Returns the time at the beginning of the bar. Time is UTC, formatted as yyyy-MMddTHH:
mm:ssZ , so for example: 2019-08-27T09:56:00Z .
{{timenow}}
Current time when the alert triggers, formatted in the same way as {{time}} . The precision
is to the nearest second, regardless of the chart’s timeframe.
Avoiding repainting with alerts
The most common instances of repainting traders want to avoid with alerts are ones where
they must prevent an alert from triggering at some point during the realtime bar when it would
not have triggered at its close. This can happen when these conditions are met:
The calculations used in the condition triggering the alert can vary during the realtime
bar. This will be the case with any calculation using high , low or close , for example,
which includes almost all built-in indicators. It will also be the case with the result of any
request.security() call using a higher timeframe than the chart’s, when the higher
timeframe’s current bar has not closed yet.
The alert can trigger before the close of the realtime bar, so with any frequency other
than “Once Per Bar Close”.
The simplest way to avoid this type of repainting is to configure the triggering frequency of
alerts so they only trigger on the close of the realtime bar. There is no panacea; avoiding this
type of repainting always entails waiting for confirmed information, which means the trader
must sacrifice immediacy to achieve reliability.
Note that other types of repainting such as those documented in our Repainting section may
not be preventable by simply triggering alerts on the close of realtime bars.

User Manual / Concepts / Backgrounds
Backgrounds
The bgcolor() function changes the color of the script’s background. If the script is running in
overlay = true mode, then it will color the chart’s background.
The function’s signature is:
Its color parameter allows a “series color” to be used for its argument, so it can be
dynamically calculated in an expression.
If the correct transparency is not part of the color to be used, it can be be generated using
the color.new() function.
Here is a script that colors the background of trading sessions (try it on 30min EURUSD, for
example):
Note that:
The script only works on chart timeframes of 30min or less. It prints an error message
when the chart’s timeframe is higher than 30min.
When the if structure’s else branch is used because the chart’s timeframe is incorrect,
the local block returns the NO_COLOR color so that no background is displayed in that
case.
We first initialize constants using our base colors, which include the 40 transparency in
hex notation at the end. 40 in the hexadecimal notation on the reversed 00-FF scale for
transparency corresponds to 75 in Pine Script™‘s 0-100 decimal scale for transparency.
We provide color inputs allowing script users to change the default colors we propose.
In our next example, we generate a gradient for the background of a CCI line:
Note that:
We use the ta.cci() built-in function to calculate the indicator value.
We use the ta.percentrank() built-in function to calculate myCCIPosition , i.e., the
percentage of past myCCI values in the last 100 bars that are below the current value of
myCCI .
To calculate the gradient, we use two different calls of the color.from_gradient() built-in:
one for the bull gradient when myCCIPosition is in the 50-100% range, which means
that more past values are below its current value, and another for the bear gradient
when myCCIPosition is in the 0-49.99% range, which means that more past values are
above it.
We provide inputs so the user can change the bull/bear colors, and we place both color
input widgets on the same line using inline = "1" in both input.color() calls.
We plot the CCI signal using two plot() calls to achieve the best contrast over the busy
background: the first plot is a 3-pixel wide white background, the second plot() call plots
the thin, 1-pixel wide black line.

Bar plotting
Introduction
The plotcandle() built-in function is used to plot candles. plotbar() is used to plot conventional
bars.
Both functions require four arguments that will be used for the OHLC prices (open, high, low,
close) of the bars they will be plotting. If one of those is na, no bar is plotted.
Plotting candles with `plotcandle()`
The signature of plotcandle() is:
This plots simple candles, all in blue, using the habitual OHLC values, in a separate pane:
To color them green or red, we can use the following code:
Note that the color parameter accepts “series color” arguments, so constant values such as
color.red , color.lime , "#FF9090" , as well as expressions that calculate colors at runtime,
as is done with the paletteColor variable here, will all work.
You can build bars or candles using values other than the actual OHLC values. For example
you could calculate and plot smoothed candles using the following code, which also colors
wicks depending on the position of close relative to the smoothed close ( c ) of our indicator:
You may find it useful to plot OHLC values taken from a higher timeframe. You can, for
example, plot daily bars on an intraday chart:
Note that:
We show the script’s plot after having used “Visual Order/Bring to Front” from the
script’s “More” menu. This causes our script’s candles to appear on top of the chart’s
candles.
The script will only display candles when two conditions are met:
The chart is using an intraday timeframe (see the check on
timeframe.isintraday in the plotcandle() call). We do this because it’s not useful to
show a daily value on timeframes higher or equal to 1D.
The
request.security() function returns non na values (see gaps = barmerge.gaps_on in
the function call).
We use a tuple ( [open, high, low, close] ) with request.security() to fetch four values
in one call.
We use var to declare our UP_COLOR and DN_COLOR color constants on bar zero only.
We use constants because those colors are used in more than one place in our code.
This way, if we need to change them, we need only do so in one place.
We create a lighter transparency for the body of our candles in the bodyColor variable
initialization, so they don’t obstruct the chart’s candles.
Plotting bars with `plotbar()`
The signature of plotbar() is:
Note that plotbar() has no parameter for bordercolor or wickcolor , as there are no borders
or wicks on conventional bars.
This plots conventional bars using the same coloring logic as in the second example of the
previous section:

Bar states
Introduction
A set of built-in variables in the barstate namespace allow your script to detect different
properties of the bar on which the script is currently executing.
These states can be used to restrict the execution or the logic of your code to specific bars.
Some built-ins return information on the trading session the current bar belongs to. They are
explained in the Session states section.
Bar state built-in variables
Note that while indicators and libraries run on all price or volume updates in real time,
strategies not using calc_on_every_tick will not; they will only execute when the realtime bar
closes. This will affect the detection of bar states in that type of script. On open markets, for
example, this code will not display a background until the realtime closes because that is
when the strategy runs:
`barstate.isfirst`
barstate.isfirst is only true on the dataset’s first bar, i.e., when bar_index is zero.
It can be useful to initialize variables on the first bar only, e.g.:
`barstate.islast`
barstate.islast is true if the current bar is the last one on the chart, whether that bar is a
realtime bar or not.
It can be used to restrict the execution of code to the chart’s last bar, which is often useful
when drawing lines, labels or tables. Here, we use it to determine when to update a label
which we want to appear only on the last bar. We create the label only once and then update
its properties using label.set_*() functions because it is more efficient:
`barstate.ishistory`
barstate.ishistory is true on all historical bars. It can never be true on a bar when
barstate.isrealtime is also true , and it does not become true on a realtime bar’s closing
update, when barstate.isconfirmed becomes true . On closed markets, it can be true on
the same bar where barstate.islast is also true .
`barstate.isrealtime`
barstate.isrealtime is true if the current data update is a real-time bar update, false
otherwise (thus it is historical). Note that barstate.islast is also true on all realtime bars.
`barstate.isnew`
barstate.isnew is true on all historical bars and on the realtime bar’s first (opening) update.
All historical bars are considered new bars because the Pine Script™ runtime executes your
script on each bar sequentially, from the chart’s first bar in time, to the last. Each historical bar
is thus discovered by your script as it executes, bar to bar.
barstate.isnew can be useful to reset varip variables when a new realtime bar comes in. The
following code will reset updateNo to 1 on all historical bars and at the beginning of each
realtime bar. It calculates the number of realtime updates during each realtime bar:
`barstate.isconfirmed`
barstate.isconfirmed is true on all historical bars and on the last (closing) update of a
realtime bar.
It can be useful to avoid repainting by requiring the realtime bar to be closed before a
condition can become true . We use it here to hold plotting of our RSI until the realtime bar
closes and becomes an elapsed realtime bar. It will plot on historical bars because
barstate.isconfirmed is always true on them:
barstate.isconfirmed will not work when used in a request.security() call.
`barstate.islastconfirmedhistory`
barstate.islastconfirmedhistory is true if the script is executing on the dataset’s last bar
when the market is closed, or on the bar immediately preceding the realtime bar if the market
is open.
It can be used to detect the first realtime bar with barstate.islastconfirmedhistory[1] , or
to postpone server-intensive calculations until the last historical bar, which would otherwise
be undetectable on open markets.
Example
Here is an example of a script using barstate.* variables:
Note that:
Each state’s name will appear in the label’s text when it is true .
There are five possible colors for the label’s background:
fuchsia on the first bar
silver on historical bars
gray on the last confirmed historical bar
orange when a realtime bar is confirmed (when it closes and becomes an elapsed
realtime bar)
red on the realtime bar’s first execution
yellow for other executions of the realtime bar
We begin by adding the indicator to the chart of an open market, but before any realtime
update is received. Note how the last confirmed history bar is identified in #1, and how the
last bar is identified as the last one, but is still considered a historical bar because no realtime
updates have been received.
Let’s look at what happens when realtime updates start coming in:
Note that:
The realtime bar is red because it is its first execution, because barstate.isnew is
true and barstate.ishistory is no longer true , so our switch structure determing
our color uses the barstate.isnew => color.red branch. This will usually not last long
because on the next update barstate.isnew will no longer be true so the label’s color
will turn yellow.
The label of elapsed realtime bars is orange because those bars were not historical bars
when they closed. Accordingly, the barstate.ishistory => color.silver branch in the
switch structure was not executed, but the next one, barstate.isconfirmed =>
color.orange was.
This last example shows how the realtime bar’s label will turn yellow after the first execution
on the bar. This is the way the label will usually appear on realtime bars:

Chart information
Chart
information
Introduction
The way scripts can obtain information about the chart and symbol they are currently runningon is through a subset of Pine Script™‘s
built-in variables
. The ones we cover here allowscripts to access information relating to:
The chart’s prices and volume
The chart’s symbol
The chart’s timeframe
The session (or time period) the symbol trades on
Prices and
volume
The built-in variables for OHLCV values are:
open
: the bar’s opening price.
high
: the bar’s highest price, or the highest price reached during the realtime bar’selapsed time.
low
: the bar’s lowest price, or the lowest price reached during the realtime bar’s elapsedtime.
close
: the bar’s closing price, or the
current price
in the realtime bar.
volume
: the volume traded during the bar, or the volume traded during the realtime bar’selapsed time. The unit of volume information varies with the instrument. It is in sharesfor stocks, in lots for forex, in contracts for futures, in the base currency for crypto, etc.
Other values are available through:
hl2
: the average of the bar’s
high
and
low
values.
hlc3
: the average of the bar’s
high
,
low
and
close
values.
ohlc4
: the average of the bar’s
open
,
high
,
low
and
close
values.
On historical bars, the values of the above variables do not vary during the bar because onlyOHLCV information is available on them. When running on historical bars, scripts execute onthe bar’s
close
, when all the bar’s information is known and cannot change during the script’sexecution on the bar.
Realtime bars are another story altogether. When indicators (or strategies using
calc_on_every_tick = true
) run in realtime, the values of the above variables (except
open
)will vary between successive iterations of the script on the realtime bar, because theyrepresent their
current
value at one point in time during the progress of the realtime bar. Thismay lead to one form of
repainting
. See the page on Pine Script™‘s
execution model
for moredetails.
The
[]
history-referencing operator
can be used to refer to past values of the built-invariables, e.g.,
close[1]
refers to the value of
close
on the previous bar, relative to theparticular bar the script is executing on.
Symbol
information
Built-in variables in the
syminfo
namespace provide scripts with information on the symbolof the chart the script is running on. This information changes every time a script userchanges the chart’s symbol. The script then re-executes on all the chart’s bars using the newvalues of the built-in variables:
syminfo.basecurrency
: the base currency, e.g., “BTC” in “BTCUSD”, or “EUR” in“EURUSD”.
syminfo.currency
: the quote currency, e.g., “USD” in “BTCUSD”, or “CAD” in “USDCAD”.
syminfo.description
: The long description of the symbol.
syminfo.mintick
: The symbol’s tick value, or the minimum increment price can move in.Not to be confused with
pips
or
points
. On “ES1!” (“S&P 500 E-Mini”) the tick size is0.25 because that is the minimal increment the price moves in.
syminfo.pointvalue
: The point value is the multiple of the underlying asset determining acontract’s value. On “ES1!” (“S&P 500 E-Mini”) the point value is 50, so a contract isworth 50 times the price of the instrument.
syminfo.prefix
: The prefix is the exchange or broker’s identifier: “NASDAQ” or “BATS” for“AAPL”, “CME_MINI_DL” for “ES1!”.
syminfo.root
: It is the ticker’s prefix for structured tickers like those of futures. It is “ES”for “ES1!”, “ZW” for “ZW1!”.
syminfo.session
: It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the “Chartsettings/Symbol/Session” field is set to “Extended”, it will only return “extended” if thesymbol and the user’s feed allow for extended sessions. It is rarely displayed and usedmostly as an argument to the
session
parameter in
ticker.new()
.
syminfo.ticker
: It is the symbol’s name, without the exchange part (
syminfo.prefix
):“BTCUSD”, “AAPL”, “ES1!”, “USDCAD”.
syminfo.tickerid
: This string is rarely displayed. It is mostly used as an argument for
request.security()
‘s
symbol
parameter. It includes session, prefix and ticker information.
syminfo.timezone
: The timezone the symbol is traded in. The string is an
IANA time zonedatabase name
(e.g., “America/New_York”).
syminfo.type
: The type of market the symbol belongs to. The values are “stock”,“futures”, “index”, “forex”, “crypto”, “fund”, “dr”, “cfd”, “bond”, “warrant”, “structured” and“right”.
This script will display the values of those built-in variables on the chart:
Chart
timeframe
A script can obtain information on the type of timeframe used on the chart using these built-ins, which all return a “simple bool” result:
timeframe.isseconds
timeframe.isminutes
timeframe.isintraday
timeframe.isdaily
timeframe.isweekly
timeframe.ismonthly
timeframe.isdwm
Two additional built-ins return more specific timeframe information:
timeframe.multiplier
returns a “simple int” containing the multiplier of the timeframeunit. A chart timeframe of one hour will return
60
because intraday timeframes areexpressed in minutes. A 30sec timeframe will return
30
(seconds), a daily chart willreturn
1
(day), a quarterly chart will return
3
(months), and a yearly chart will return
12
(months). The value of this variable cannot be used as an argument to
timeframe
parameters in built-in functions, as they expect a string in timeframe specificationsformat.
timeframe.period
returns a string in Pine Script™‘s timeframe specification format.
See the page on
Timeframes
for more information.
Session
information
Session information is available in different forms:
The
syminfo.session
built-in variable returns a value that is either
session.regular
or
session.extended
. It reflects the session setting on the chart for that symbol. If the“Chart settings/Symbol/Session” field is set to “Extended”, it will only return “extended”if the symbol and the user’s feed allow for extended sessions. It is used when a sessiontype is expected, for example as the argument for the
session
parameter in
ticker.new()
.
Session state built-ins
provide information on the trading session a bar belongs to.

and the less important one to not get in the way.
Using colors in Pine can be as simple as you want, or as involved as your concept requires.
The 4,294,967,296 possible assemblies of color and transparency available in Pine Script™
can be applied to:
Any element you can plot or draw in an indicator’s visual space, be it lines, fills, text or
candles.
The background of a script’s visual space, whether the script is running in its own pane,
or in overlay mode on the chart.
The color of bars or the body of candles appearing on a chart.
A script can only color the elements it places in its own visual space. The only exception to
this rule is that a pane indicator can color chart bars or candles.
Pine Script™ has built-in colors such as color.green, as well as functions like color.rgb() which
allow you to dynamically generate any color in the RGBA color space.
Transparency
Each color in Pine Script™ is defined by four values:
Its red, green and blue components (0-255), following the RGB color model.
Its transparency (0-100), often referred to as the Alpha channel outside Pine, as defined
in the RGBA color model. Even though transparency is expressed in the 0-100 range, its
value can be a “float” when used in functions, which gives you access to the 256
underlying values of the alpha channel.
The transparency of a color defines how opaque it is: zero is fully opaque, 100 makes the
color — whichever it is — invisible. Modulating transparency can be crucial in more involved
color visuals or when using backgrounds, to control which colors dominate the others, and
how they mix together when superimposed.
Z-index
When you place elements in a script’s visual space, they have relative depth on the z axis;
some will appear on top of others. The z-index is a value that represents the position of
elements on the z axis. Elements with the highest z-index appear on top.
Elements drawn in Pine Script™ are divided in groups. Each group has its own position in the z
space, and within the same group, elements created last in the script’s logic will appear on
top of other elements from the same group. An element of one group cannot be placed
outside the region of the z space attributed to its group, so a plot can never appear on top of
a table, for example, because tables have the highest z-index.
This list contains the groups of visual elements, ordered by increasing z-index, so background
colors are always at the bottom of z space, and tables will always appear on top of all other
elements:
Background colors
Fills
Plots
Hlines
LineFills
Lines
Boxes
Labels
Tables
Note that by using explicit_plot_zorder = true in indicator() or strategy(), you can control
the relative z-index of plot*() , hline() and fill() visuals using their sequential order in the
script.
Constant colors
There are 17 built-in colors in Pine Script™. This table lists their names, hexadecimal
equivalent, and RGB values as arguments to color.rgb():
Name Hex RGB values
color.aqua #00BCD4 color.rgb(0, 188, 212)
color.black #363A45 color.rgb(54, 58, 69)
color.blue #2196F3 color.rgb(33, 150, 243)
color.fuchsia #E040FB color.rgb(224, 64, 251)
color.gray #787B86 color.rgb(120, 123, 134)
color.green #4CAF50 color.rgb(76, 175, 80)
color.lime #00E676 color.rgb(0, 230, 118)
color.maroon #880E4F color.rgb(136, 14, 79)
color.navy #311B92 color.rgb(49, 27, 146)
color.olive #808000 color.rgb(128, 128, 0)
color.orange #FF9800 color.rgb(255, 152, 0)
color.purple #9C27B0 color.rgb(156, 39, 176)
color.red #F23645 color.rgb(242, 54, 69)
color.silver #B2B5BE color.rgb(178, 181, 190)
color.teal #089981 color.rgb(8, 153, 129)
color.white #FFFFFF color.rgb(255, 255, 255)
color.yellow #FDD835 color.rgb(253, 216, 53)
In the following script, all plots use the same color.olive color with a transparency of 40, but
expressed in different ways. All five methods are functionally equivalent:
The colors in the previous script do not vary as the script executes bar to bar. Sometimes,
however, colors need to be created as the script executes on each bar because they depend
on conditions that are unknown at compile time, or when the script begins execution on bar
zero. For those cases, programmers have two options:
1. Use conditional statements to select colors from a few pre-determined base colors.
2. Build new colors dynamically, by calculating them as the script executes bar to bar, to
implement color gradients, for example.
Conditional coloring
Let’s say you want to color a moving average in different colors, depending on some
conditions you define. To do so, you can use a conditional statement that will select a
different color for each of your states. Let’s start by coloring a moving average in a bull color
when it’s rising, and in a bear color when it’s not:
Note that:
We provide users of our script a selection of colors for our bull/bear colors.
We define an maRising boolean variable which will hold true when the moving
average is higher on the current bar than it was on the last.
We define a c_ma color variable that is assigned one of our two colors, depending on
the value of the maRising boolean. We use the ? : ternary operator to write our
conditional statement.
You can also use conditional colors to avoid plotting under certain conditions. Here, we plot
high and low pivots using a line, but we do not want to plot anything when a new pivot comes
in, to avoid the joints that would otherwise appear in pivot transitions. To do so, we test for
pivot changes and use na as the color value when a change is detected, so that no line is
plotted on that bar:
To undertand how this code works, one must first know that ta.pivothigh() and ta.pivotlow(),
used as they are here without an argument to the source parameter, will return a value when
they find a high/low pivot, otherwise they return na.
When we test the value returned by the pivot function for na using the nz() function, we allow
the value returned to be assigned to the pHi or pLo variables only when it is not na,
otherwise the previous value of the variable is simply reassigned to it, which has no impact on
its value. Keep in mind that previous values of pHi and pLo are preserved bar to bar
because we use the var keyword when initializing them, which causes the initialization to only
occur on the first bar.
All that’s left to do next is, when we plot our lines, to insert a ternary conditional statement
that will yield na for the color when the pivot value changes, or the color selected in the
script’s inputs when the pivot level does not change.
Calculated colors
Using functions like color.new(), color.rgb() and color.from_gradient(), one can build colors on
the fly, as the script executes bar to bar.
color.new() is most useful when you need to generate different transparency levels from a
base color.
color.rgb() is useful when you need to build colors dynamically from red, green, blue, or
tranparency components. While color.rgb() creates a color, its sister functions color.r(),
color.g(), color.b() and color.t() can be used to extract the red, green, blue or transparency
values from a color, which can in turn be used to generate a variant.
color.from_gradient() is useful to create linear gradients between two base colors. It
determines which intermediary color to use by evaluating a source value against minimum
and maximum values.
color.new()
Let’s put color.new(color, transp) to use to create different transparencies for volume columns
using one of two bull/bear base colors:
Note that:
In the next to last line of our script, we dynamically calculate the column color by varying
both the base color used, depending on whether the bar is up or down, and the
transparency level, which is calculated from the cumulative rises or falls of volume.
We offer the script user control over not only the base bull/bear colors used, but also on
the number of brightness levels we use. We use this value to determine the maximum
number of rises or falls we will track. Giving users the possiblity to manage this value
allows them to adapt the indicator’s visuals to the timeframe or market they use.
We take care to control the maximum level of transparency we use so that it never goes
higher than 80. This ensures our colors always retain some visibility.
We also set the minimum value for the number of levels to 1 in the inputs. When the user
selects 1, the volume columns will be either in bull or bear color of maximum brightness
— or transparency zero.
color.rgb()
In our next example we use color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp) to build colors from RGBA
values. We use the result in a holiday season gift for our friends, so they can bring their
TradingView charts to parties:
Note that:
We generate values in the zero to 255 range for the red, green and blue channels, and in
the zero to 100 range for transparency. Also note that because math.random() returns
float values, the float 0.0-100.0 range provides access to the full 0-255 transparency
values of the underlying alpha channel.
We use the math.random(min, max, seed) function to generate pseudo-random values.
We do not use an argument for the third parameter of the function: seed . Using it is
handy when you want to ensure the repeatability of the function’s results. Called with
the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of values.
color.from_gradient()
Our last examples of color calculations will use color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value,
top_value, bottom_color, top_color). Let’s first use it in its simplest form, to color a CCI signal
in a version of the indicator that otherwise looks like the built-in:
Note that:
To calculate the gradient, color.from_gradient() requires minimum and maximum values
against which the argument used for the value parameter will be compared. The fact
that we want a gradient for an unbounded signal like CCI (i.e., without fixed boundaries
such as RSI, which always oscillates between 0-100), does not entail we cannot use
color.from_gradient(). Here, we solve our conundrum by providing values of -200 and
200 as arguments. They do not represent the real minimum and maximum values for
CCI, but they are at levels from which we do not mind the colors no longer changing, as
whenever the series is outside the bottom_value and top_value limits, the colors used
for bottom_color and top_color will apply.
The color progression calculated by color.from_gradient() is linear. If the value of the
series is halfway between the bottom_value and top_value arguments, the generated
color’s RGBA components will also be halfway between those of bottom_color and
top_color .
Many common indicator calculations are available in Pine Script™ as built-in functions.
Here we use ta.cci() instead of calculating it the long way.
The argument used for value in color.from_gradient() does not necessarily have to be the
value of the line we are calculating. Anything we want can be used, as long as arguments for
bottom_value and top_value can be supplied. Here, we enhance our CCI indicator by
coloring the band using the number of bars since the signal has been above/below the
centerline:
Note that:
The signal plot uses the same base colors and gradient as in our previous example. We
have however increased the width of the line from the default 1 to 2. It is the most
important component of our visuals; increasing its width is a way to give it more
prominence, and ensure users are not distracted by the band, which has become busier
than it was in its original, flat beige color.
The fill must remain unobtrusive for two reasons. First, it is of secondary importance to
the visuals, as it provides complementary information, i.e., the duration for which the
signal has been in bull/bear territory. Second, since fills have a greater z-index than
plots, the fill will cover the signal plot. For these reasons, we make the fill’s base colors
fairly transparent, at 70, so they do not mask the plots. The gradient used for the band
starts with no color at all (see the na used as the argument to bottom_color in the
color.from_gradient() call), and goes to the base bull/bear colors from the inputs, which
the conditional, c_endColor color variable contains.
We provide users with distinct bull/bear color selections for the line and the band.
When we calculate the gradientStep variable, we use nz() on ta.barssince() because in
early bars of the dataset, when the condition tested has not occurred yet, ta.barssince()
will return na. Because we use nz(), the value returned is replaced with zero in those
cases.
Mixing transparencies
In this example we take our CCI indicator in another direction. We will build dynamically
adjusting extremes zone buffers using a Donchian Channel (historical highs/lows) calculated
from the CCI. We build the top/bottom bands by making them 1/4 the height of the DC. We will
use a dynamically adjusting lookback to calculate the DC. To modulate the lookback, we will
calculate a simple measure of volatility by keeping a ratio of a short-period ATR to a long one.
When that ratio is higher than 50 of its last 100 values, we consider the volatility high. When
the volatility is high/low, we decrease/increase the lookback.
Our aim is to provide users of our indicator with:
The CCI line colored using a bull/bear gradient, as we illustrated in our most recent
examples.
The top and bottom bands of the Donchian Channel, filled in such a way that their color
darkens as a historical high/low becomes older and older.
A way to appreciate the state of our volatility measure, which we will do by painting the
background with one color whose intensity increases when volatility increases.
This is what our indicator looks like using the light theme:
And with the dark theme:
Note that:
We clamp the transparency of the background to a 100-75 range so that it doesn’t
overwhelm. We also use a neutral color that will not distract too much. The darker the
background is, the higher our measure of volatility.
We also clamp the transparency values for the band fills between 60 and 90. We use 90
so that when a new high/low is found and the gradient resets, the starting transparency
makes the color somewhat visible. We do not use a transparency lower than 60 because
we don’t want those bands to hide the signal line.
We use the very handy ta.percentrank() function to generate a 0-100 value from our
ATR ratio measuring volatility. It is useful to convert values whose scale is unknown into
known values that can be used to produce transparencies.
Because we must clamp values three times in our script, we wrote an f_clamp()
function, instead of explicitly coding the logic three times.
Tips
Maintaining automatic color selectors
Under certain conditions, PineScript can automatically display all of the colors used in script’s
plots in the “Settings/Styles” menu. These plots are graphics created by all plot*() functions,
barcolor(), and bgcolor(). The user can change the colors using a color picker. This feature
allows colors in scripts to be customized without any extra code.
For example, this simple script has a plot() that is colored either teal or red, depending on the
relationship between the bar’s close and open. The script does not specify that these colors
should be editable, nor does it create any color-related inputs. Nevertheless, PineScript
automatically displays the colors in the “Settings/Styles” menu and allows the user to change
them, along with the style of the plot:
The colors in the above script can be automatically displayed in this way because they are
already known during compilation. Colors that are known during compilation are of type
“const” or “input” only.
However, if even a single calculated color is of type “simple color” or “series color”, all colors
are calculated in the script’s runtime, and no color pickers are available in the “Style” section.
In practice, the creation of “simple” or “series” colors is most often due to using color.new()
and color.rgb() functions. The qualifier of the color that they return is the strongest qualifier of
the values passed to these functions. If each call to these functions passes only “const” or
“input” values, the resulting colors are also “const” or “input”, and the script does display
them in the “Styles” menu.
For example, let’s try to make the plots in the script above semi-transparent by adding a
transparency of 50 to its colors via color.new(). The easiest way to do this is to wrap the
plotColor variable with color.new(), like in the example below:
Unfortunately, with these changes the “Style” tab does not display a color picker any longer.
This is because we use the “series bool” condition close > open to decide the color, and
then pass the result of this expression to a single color.new() call. The qualified type of the
calculated color that it returns is “series color”.
To avoid this, we can ensure that every calculated color created by color.new() is a “const
color”. Below, we wrap teal and red separately with color.new() – creating two constant
calculated colors in the process – and then decide which one to assign to plotColor based
on the condition. And while the plotColor variable is a “series color”, each color.new() call
returns a constant color, so the script displays a color picker n the “Style” tab:
To calculate the colors at runtime, create custom color inputs for all of the colors that are to
be editable. This approach requires more effort, but allows significantly more control over
what the user can affect. Learn more about creating color inputs on the Inputs page.
Designing usable colors schemes
If you write scripts intended for other traders, try to avoid colors that will not work well in
some environments, whether it be for plots, labels, tables or fills. At a minimum, test your
visuals to ensure they perform satisfactorily with both the light and dark TradingView themes;
they are the most commonly used. Colors such as black and white, for example, should be
avoided.
Build the appropriate inputs to provide script users the flexibility to adapt your script’s visuals
to their particular environments.
Take care to build a visual hierarchy of the colors you use that matches the relative
importance of your script’s visual components. Good designers understand how to achieve
the optimal balance of color and weight so the eye is naturally drawn to the most important
elements of the design. When you make everything stand out, nothing does. Make room for
some elements to stand out by toning down the visuals surrounding it.
Providing a selection of color presets in your inputs — rather than a single color that can be
changed — can help color-challenged users. Our Technical Ratings demonstrates one way of
achieving this.
Plot crisp lines
It is best to use zero transparency to plot the important lines in your visuals, to keep them
crisp. This way, they will show through fills more precisely. Keep in mind that fills have a
higher z-index than plots, so they are placed on top of them. A slight increase of a line’s width
can also go a long way in making it stand out.
If you want a special plot to stand out, you can also give it more importance by using multiple
plots for the same line. These are examples where we modulate the successive width and
transparency of plots to achieve this:
Customize gradients
When building gradients, adapt them to the visuals they apply to. If you are using a gradient
to color candles, for example, it is usually best to limit the number of steps in the gradient to
ten or less, as it is more difficult for the eye to perceive intensity variations of discrete objects.
As we did in our examples, cap minimum and maximum transparency levels so your visual
elements remain visible and do not overwhelm when it’s not necessary.

This use should be avoided as the transp is deprecated in Pine Script™ v5. Using the
transp parameter to define transparency is not as flexible because it requires an
argument of input integer type, which entails it must be known before the script is
executed, and so cannot be calculated dynamically, as your script executes bar to bar.
Additionally, if you use a color argument that already includes transparency
information, as is done in the next three plot() calls, any argument used for the
transp parameter would have no effect. This is also true for other functions with a
transp parameter.

User Manual / Concepts / Fills

Introduction
Some of Pine Script’s visual outputs, including plots, hlines, lines, boxes, and polylines, allow
one to fill the chart space they occupy with colors. Three different mechanisms facilitate
filling the space between such outputs:
The fill() function fills the space between two plots from plot() calls or two horizontal
lines (hlines) from hline() calls with a specified color.
Objects of the linefill type fill the space between line instances created with line.new().
Other drawing types, namely boxes and polylines, have built-in properties that allow the
drawings to fill the visual spaces they occupy.
`plot()` and `hline()` fills
The fill() function fills the space between two plots or horizontal lines. It has the following two
signatures:
The plot1 , plot2 , hline1 , and hline2 parameters accept plot or hline IDs returned by
plot() and hline() function calls. The fill() function is the only built-in that can use these IDs.
This simple example demonstrates how the fill() function works with plot and hline IDs. It calls
plot() and hline() three times to display arbitrary values on the chart. Each of these calls
returns an ID, which the script assigns to variables for use in the fill() function. The values of
p1 , p2 , and p3 are “plot” IDs, whereas h1 , h2 , and h3 reference “hline” IDs:
It’s important to note that the fill() function requires either two “plot” IDs or two “hline” IDs.
One cannot mix and match these types in the function call. Consequently, programmers will
sometimes need to use plot() where they otherwise might have used hline() if they want to fill
the space between a consistent level and a fluctuating series.
For example, this script calculates an oscillator based on the percentage distance
between the chart’s close price and a 10-bar SMA, then plots it on the chart pane. In this
case, we wanted to fill the area between the oscillator and zero. Although we can display
the zero level with hline() since its value does not change, we cannot pass a “plot” and “hline”
ID to the fill() function. Therefore, we must use a plot() call for the level to allow the script to
fill the space:
The color parameter of the fill() function accepts a “series color” argument, meaning the
fill’s color can change across chart bars. For example, this code fills the space between two
moving average plots with 90% transparent green or red colors based on whether ma1 is
above ma2 :
Line fills
While the fill() function allows a script to fill the space between two plots or hlines, it does not
work with line objects. When a script needs to fill the space between lines, it requires a linefill
object created by the linefill.new() function. The function has the following signature:
The line1 and line2 parameters accept line IDs. These IDs determine the chart region that
the linefill object will fill with its specified color . A script can update the color property of a
linefill ID returned by this function by calling linefill.set_color() with the ID as its id argument.
The behavior of linefills depends on the lines they reference. Scripts cannot move linefills
directly, as the lines that a linefill uses determine the space it will fill. To retrieve the IDs of the
lines referenced by a linefill object, use the linefill.get_line1() and linefill.get_line2() functions.
Any pair of line instances can only have one linefill between them. Successive calls to
linefill.new() using the same line1 and line2 arguments will create a new linefill ID that
replaces the previous one associated with them.
The example below demonstrates a simple use case for linefills. The script calculates a
pivotHigh and pivotLow series using the built-in ta.pivothigh() and ta.pivotlow() functions
with constant leftbars and rightbars arguments. On the last confirmed historical bar, the
script draws two extended lines. The first line connects the two most recent non-na
pivotHigh values, and the second connects the most recent non-na pivotLow values.
To emphasize the “channel” formed by these lines, the script fills the space between them
using linefill.new():
Box and polyline fills
The box and polyline types allow scripts to draw geometric shapes and other formations on
the chart. Scripts create boxes and polylines with the box.new() and polyline.new() functions,
which include parameters that allow the drawings to fill their visual spaces.
To fill the space inside the borders of a box with a specified color, include a bgcolor
argument in the box.new() function. To fill a polyline’s visual space, pass a fill_color
argument to the polyline.new() function.
For example, this script draws an octagon with a polyline and an inscribed rectangle with a
box on the last confirmed historical bar. It determines the size of the drawings using the value
from the radius variable, which corresponds to approximately one-fourth of the number of
bars visible on the chart. We included fill_color = color.new(color.blue, 60) in the
polyline.new() call to fill the octagon with a translucent blue color, and we used bgcolor =
color.purple in the box.new() call to fill the inscribed rectangle with opaque purple:
See this manual’s Lines and boxes page to learn more about working with these types.

Inputs are only accessible while a script runs on a chart. Users can access script inputs from
the “Settings” dialog box. To open this dialog, users can:
Double-click on the name of an on-chart indicator
Right-click on the script’s name and choose the “Settings” item from the dropdown
menu
Choose the “Settings” item from the “More” menu icon (three dots) that appears when
hovering over the indicator’s name on the chart
Double-click on the indicator’s name from the Data Window (fourth icon down to the
right of the chart)
The “Settings” dialog always contains the “Style” and “Visibility” tabs, which allow users to
specify their preferences about the script’s visuals and the chart timeframes that can display
its outputs.
When a script contains calls to input.*() functions, an “Inputs” tab also appears in the
“Settings” dialog box.
Scripts process inputs when users add them to the chart or change the values in the script’s
“Settings/Inputs” tab. Any changes to a script’s inputs prompt it to re-execute across all
available data using the new specified values.
Input functions
Pine Script™ features the following input functions:
input()
input.int()
input.float()
input.bool()
input.color()
input.string()
input.text_area()
input.timeframe()
input.symbol()
input.price()
input.source()
input.session()
input.time()
input.enum()
Scripts create input widgets in the “Inputs” tab that accept different types of inputs based on
their input.*() function calls. By default, each input appears on a new line of the “Inputs”
tab in the order of the input.*() calls. Programmers can also organize inputs in different
ways by using the input.*() functions’ group and inline parameters. See this section
below for more information.
Our Style guide recommends placing input.*() calls at the beginning of the script.
Input functions typically contain several parameters that allow programmers to define their
default values, value limits, their organization in the “Inputs” tab, and other properties.
Since an input.*() call is simply another function call in Pine Script™, programmers can
combine them with arithmetic, comparison, logical, and ternary operators to assign
expressions to variables. This simple script compares the result from a call to input.string() to
the “On” string and assigns the result to the plotDisplayInput variable. This variable is of
the “input bool” type because the == operator returns a “bool” value:
All values returned by input.*() functions except “source” ones are “input” qualified values.
See our User Manual’s section on type qualifiers for more information.
Input function parameters
The parameters common to all input functions are: defval , title , tooltip , inline ,
group , and display . Some input functions also include other parameters: options ,
minval , maxval , step and confirm .
All these parameters expect “const” arguments. The only exceptions are for the defval and
options parameters of the source and enum inputs, as input.source() uses “series float”
value, and input.enum() uses members of an enum type.
Since input.*() parameters accept “const” arguments in most cases and the “input” and
other qualifiers are stronger than “const”, it follows that one cannot use the result from one
input.*() call as an argument in another input.*() call.
Let’s go over each parameter:
defval is the first parameter of all input functions. It is the default value that appears in
the input widget. It requires an argument of the type of input value that the function
applies to.
title requires a “const string” argument. It is the field’s label.
tooltip requires a “const string” argument. When the parameter is used, a question
mark icon will appear to the right of the field. When users hover over it, the tooltip’s text
will appear. Note that if multiple input fields are grouped on one line using inline , the
tooltip will always appear to the right of the rightmost field, and display the text of the
last tooltip argument used in the line. Newlines ( \n ) are supported in the argument
string.
inline requires a “const string” argument. Using the same argument for the parameter
in multiple input.*() calls will group their input widgets on the same line. There is a
limit to the width the “Inputs” tab will expand, so a limited quantity of input fields can be
fitted on one line. Using one input.*() call with a unique argument for inline has the
effect of bringing the input field left, immediately after the label, foregoing the default
left-alignment of all input fields used when no inline argument is used.
group requires a “const string” argument. Use it to group any number of inputs in an
organized section. The string used as the group argument becomes the section’s
heading. All input.*() calls to be grouped together must use the same string for their
group argument.
options requires a comma-separated list of elements enclosed in square brackets
(e.g., ["ON", "OFF"] , [1, 2, 3] , [myEnum.On, myEnum.Off] ). The input uses the
specified elements as menu selections in its resulting dropdown widget. Users can only
select one menu item at a time. When supplying an options list, the defval value
must be one of the list’s elements. Inputs that allow minval , maxval , or step
parameters cannot use those parameters and the options parameter simultaneously.
minval requires a “const int/float” argument, depending on the type of the defval
value. It is the minimum valid value for the input field.
maxval requires a “const int/float” argument, depending on the type of the defval
value. It is the maximum valid value for the input field.
step is the increment by which the field’s value will move when the widget’s up/down
arrows are used.
confirm requires a “const bool” ( true or false ) argument. This parameter affects
the behavior of the script when it is added to a chart. input.*() calls using confirm =
true will cause the “Settings/Inputs” tab to popup when the script is added to the chart.
confirm is useful to ensure that users configure a particular field.
The minval , maxval and step parameters are only present in the signature of the
input.int() and input.float() functions.
Input types
The next sections explain what each input function does. As we proceed, we will explore the
different ways you can use input functions and organize their display.
Generic input
input() is a simple, generic function that supports the fundamental Pine Script™ types: “int”,
“float”, “bool”, “color” and “string”. It also supports “source” inputs, which are price-related
values such as close, hl2, hlc3, and hlcc4, or which can be used to receive the output value of
another script.
Its signature is:
The function automatically detects the type of input by analyzing the type of the defval
argument used in the function call. This script shows all the supported types and the qualified
type returned by the function when used with defval arguments of different types:
Integer input
Two signatures exist for the input.int() function; one when options is not used, the other
when it is:
This call uses the options parameter to propose a pre-defined list of lengths for the MA:
This one uses the minval parameter to limit the length:
The version with the options list uses a dropdown menu for its widget. When the options
parameter is not used, a simple input widget is used to enter the value:
Float input
Two signatures exist for the input.float() function; one when options is not used, the other
when it is:
Here, we use a “float” input for the factor used to multiple the standard deviation, to calculate
Bollinger Bands:
The input widgets for floats are similar to the ones used for integer inputs:
Boolean input
Let’s continue to develop our script further, this time by adding a boolean input to allow users
to toggle the display of the BBs:
Note that:
We have added an input using input.bool() to set the value of showBBInput .
We use the inline parameter in that input and in the one for bbFactorInput to bring
them on the same line. We use "01" for its argument in both cases. That is how the
Pine Script™ compiler recognizes that they belong on the same line. The particular
string used as an argument is unimportant and does not appear anywhere in the
“Inputs” tab; it is only used to identify which inputs go on the same line.
We have vertically aligned the title arguments of our input.*() calls to make them
easier to read.
We use the showBBInput variable in our two plot() calls to plot conditionally. When the
user unchecks the checkbox of the showBBInput input, the variable’s value becomes
false . When that happens, our plot() calls plot the na value, which displays nothing.
We use true as the default value of the input, so the BBs plot by default.
Because we use the inline parameter for the bbFactorInput variable, its input field in
the “Inputs” tab does not align vertically with that of maLengthInput , which doesn’t use
inline .
Color input
As explained in this section of the Colors page, selecting the colors of a script’s outputs via
the “Settings/Style” tab is not always possible. In the case where one cannot choose colors
from the “Style” tab, programmers can create color inputs with the input.color() function to
allow color customization from the “Settings/Inputs” tab.
Suppose we wanted to plot our BBs with a ligther transparency when the high and low values
are higher/lower than the BBs. We can use a code like this to create the colors:
When using dynamic (“series”) color components like the transp arguments in the above
code, the color widgets in the “Settings/Style” tab will no longer appear. Let’s create our own
input for color selection, which will appear in the “Settings/Inputs” tab:
Note that:
We have added two calls to input.color() to gather the values of the maColorInput and
bbColorInput variables. We use maColorInput directly in the plot(ma, "MA",
maColorInput) call, and we use bbColorInput to build the bbHiColor and bbLoColor
variables, which modulate the transparency using the position of price relative to the
BBs. We use a conditional value for the transp value we call color.new() with, to
generate different transparencies of the same base color.
We do not use a title argument for our new color inputs because they are on the
same line as other inputs allowing users to understand to which plots they apply.
We have reorganized our inline arguments so they reflect the fact we have inputs
grouped on two distinct lines.
Timeframe input
Timeframe inputs can be useful when you want to be able to change the timeframe used to
calculate values in your scripts.
Let’s do away with our BBs from the previous sections and add a timeframe input to a simple
MA script:
Note that:
We use the input.timeframe() function to receive the timeframe input.
The function creates a dropdown widget where some standard timeframes are
proposed. The list of timeframes also includes any you have favorated in the chart user
interface.
We use the tfInput in our request.security() call. We also use gaps =
barmerge.gaps_on in the call, so the function only returns data when the higher
timeframe has completed.
Symbol input
The input.symbol() function creates a widget that allows users to search and select symbols
like they would from the chart’s user interface.
Let’s add a symbol input to our script:
Note that:
The defval argument we use is an empty string. This causes request.security(), where
we use the symbolInput variable containing that input, to use the chart’s symbol by
default. If the user selects another symbol and wants to return to the default value using
the chart’s symbol, he will need to use the “Reset Settings” selection from the “Inputs”
tab’s “Defaults” menu.
We use the securityNoRepaint() user-defined function to use request.security() in
such a way that it does not repaint; it only returns values when the higher timeframe has
completed.
Session input
Session inputs are useful to gather start-stop values for periods of time. The input.session()
built-in function creates an input widget allowing users to specify the beginning and end time
of a session. Selections can be made using a dropdown menu, or by entering time values in
“hh:mm” format.
The value returned by input.session() is a valid string in session format. See the manual’s
page on sessions for more information.
Session information can also contain information on the days where the session is valid. We
use an input.string() function call here to input that day information:
Note that:
This script proposes a default session of “0600-1700”.
The input.string() call uses a tooltip to provide users with help on the format to use to
enter day information.
A complete session string is built by concatenating the two strings the script receives as
inputs.
We explicitly declare the type of our two inputs with the string keyword to make it clear
those variables will contain a string.
We detect if the chart bar is in the user-defined session by calling time() with the
session string. If the current bar’s time value (the time at the bar’s open) is not in the
session, time() returns na, so inSession will be true whenever time() returns a value
that is not na.
Source input
Source inputs are useful to provide a selection of two types of sources:
Price values, namely: open, high, low, close, hl2, hlc3, and ohlc4.
The values plotted by other scripts on the chart. This can be useful to “link” two or more
scripts together by sending the output of one as an input to another script.
This script simply plots the user’s selection of source. We propose the high as the default
value:
This shows a chart where, in addition to our script, we have loaded an “Arnaud Legoux Moving
Average” indicator. See here how we use our script’s source input widget to select the output
of the ALMA script as an input into our script. Because our script plots that source in a lightpurple
thick line, you see the plots from the two scripts overlap because they plot the same
value:
Time input
Time inputs use the input.time() function. The function returns a Unix time in milliseconds
(see the Time page for more information). This type of data also contains date information, so
the input.time() function returns a time and a date. That is the reason why its widget allows
for the selection of both.
Here, we test the bar’s time against an input value, and we plot an arrow when it is greater:
Note that the defval value we use is a call to the timestamp() function.
Enum input
The input.enum() function creates a dropdown input that displays field titles corresponding to
distinct members (possible values) of an enum type. The function returns one of the unique,
named values from a declared enum, which scripts can use in calculations and logic requiring
more strict control over allowed values and operations. Supply a list of enum members to the
options parameter to specify the members users can select from the dropdown. If one does
not specify an enum field’s title, its title is the “string” representation of its name.
This example declares a SignalType enum with four fields representing named signal display
modes: long , short , both , and none . The script uses a member of this enum type as the
defval argument in the input.enum() call to generate a dropdown in the “Inputs” tab,
allowing users to select one of the enum’s titles to control which signals it displays on the
chart:
Note that:
The sigInput value is the SignalType member whose field contains the selected title.
Since we did not specify a title for the none field of the enum, its title is the “string”
representation of its name (“none”), as we see in the above image of the enum input’s
dropdown.
By default, an enum input displays the titles of all an enum’s members within its dropdown. If
we supply an options argument to the input.enum() call, it will only allow users to select the
members included in that list, e.g.:
The above options argument specifies that users can only view and select the titles of the
long and short fields from the SignalType enum. No other options are allowed:
Other features affecting Inputs
Some parameters of the indicator() and strategy() functions populate a script’s
“Settings/Inputs” tab with additional inputs. These parameters are timeframe ,
timeframe_gaps , and calc_bars_count . For example:
Tips
The design of your script’s inputs has an important impact on the usability of your scripts.
Well-designed inputs are more intuitively usable and make for a better user experience:
Choose clear and concise labels (your input’s title argument).
Choose your default values carefully.
Provide minval and maxval values that will prevent your code from producing
unexpected results, e.g., limit the minimal value of lengths to 1 or 2, depending on the
type of MA you are using.
Provide a step value that is congruent with the value you are capturing. Steps of 5 can
be more useful on a 0-200 range, for example, or steps of 0.05 on a 0.0-1.0 scale.
Group related inputs on the same line using inline ; bull and bear colors for example,
or the width and color of a line.
When you have many inputs, group them into meaningful sections using group . Place
the most important sections at the top.
Do the same for individual inputs within sections.
It can be advantageous to vertically align different arguments of multliple input.*() calls in
your code. When you need to make global changes, this will allow you to use the Editor’s
multi-cursor feature to operate on all the lines at once.
Because It is sometimes necessary to use Unicode spaces to In order to achieve optimal
alignment in inputs. This is an example:
Note that:
We use the group parameter to distinguish between the two sections of inputs. We use
a constant to hold the name of the groups. This way, if we decide to change the name of
the group, we only need to change it in one place.
The first sections inputs widgets do not align vertically. We are using inline , which
places the input widgets immediately to the right of the label. Because the labels for the
ma1SourceInput and long1SourceInput inputs are of different lengths the labels are in
different y positions.
To make up for the misalignment, we pad the title argument in the ma2SourceInput
line with three Unicode EN spaces (U+2002). Unicode spaces are necessary because
ordinary spaces would be stripped from the label. You can achieve precise alignment by
combining different quantities and types of Unicode spaces. See here for a list of
Unicode spaces of different widths.

User Manual / Concepts / Levels
Levels
`hline()` levels
Levels are lines plotted using the hline() function. It is designed to plot horizontal levels using
a single color, i.e., it does not change on different bars. See the Levels section of the page on
plot() for alternative ways to plot levels when hline() won’t do what you need.
The function has the following signature:
hline() has a few constraints when compared to plot():
Since the function’s objective is to plot horizontal lines, its price parameter requires an
“input int/float” argument, which means that “series float” values such as close or
dynamically-calculated values cannot be used.
Its color parameter requires an “input int” argument, which precludes the use of
dynamic colors, i.e., colors calculated on each bar — or “series color” values.
Three different line styles are supported through the linestyle parameter:
hline.style_solid , hline.style_dotted and hline.style_dashed .
Let’s see hline() in action in the “True Strength Index” indicator:
Note that:
We display 5 levels, each of a different color.
We use a different line style for the zero centerline.
We choose colors that will work well on both light and dark themes.
The usual range for the indicator’s values is +100 to -100. Since the ta.tsi() built-in
returns values in the +1 to -1 range, we make the adjustment in our code.
Fills between levels
The space between two levels plotted with hline() can be colored using fill(). Keep in mind
that both plots must have been plotted with hline().
Let’s put some background colors in our TSI indicator:
Note that:
We have now used the return value of our hline() function calls, which is of the hline
special type. We use the plus50Hline , plus25Hline , zeroHline , minus25Hline and
minus50Hline variables to store those “hline” IDs because we will need them in our fill()
calls later.
To generate lighter color shades for the background colors, we declare a fillColor()
function that accepts a color and returns its 90 transparency. We use calls to that
function for the color arguments in our fill() calls.
We make our fill() calls for each of the four different fills we want, between four different
pairs of levels.
We use color.teal in our second fill because it produces a green that fits the color
scheme better than the color.green used for the 25 level.

User Manual / Concepts / Libraries
Libraries
Introduction
Pine Script™ libraries are publications containing functions that can be reused in indicators,
strategies, or in other libraries. They are useful to define frequently-used functions so their
source code does not have to be included in every script where they are needed.
A library must be published (privately or publicly) before it can be used in another script. All
libraries are published open-source. Public scripts can only use public libraries and they must
be open-source. Private scripts or personal scripts saved in the Pine Script™ Editor can use
public or private libraries. A library can use other libraries, or even previous versions of itself.
Library programmers should be familiar with Pine Script™‘s typing nomenclature, scopes and
user-defined functions. If you need to brush up on qualified types, see the User Manual’s
page on the Type system. For more information on user-defined functions and scopes, see
the User-defined functions page.
You can browse the library scripts published publicly by members in TradingView’s
Community Scripts.
Creating a library
A library is a special kind of script that begins with the library() declaration statement, rather
than indicator() or strategy(). A library contains exportable function, method, UDT, and enum
definitions, which constitute the only visible part of the library when imported by another
script. Like other script types, libraries can also include Pine Script™ code in their global
scopes. Programmers typically use a library’s global code to demonstrate how other scripts
can use its exported structures.
A library script has a structure like the following, which must include one or more exportable
functions or types:
Note that:
The //@description , //@enum , //@type , @field , // @function , // @param , and //
@returns compiler annotations are optional but we highly recommend you use them.
These annotations document the library’s code and populate the default library
description, which authors can use when publishing the library.
The export keyword is mandatory.
<parameter_type> is mandatory, contrary to user-defined function parameter definitions
in indicators or strategies, which are typeless.
<script_code> can be any code one would normally use in an indicator, including inputs.
This is an example library:
Library functions
Exported functions and methods have slightly different requirements and constraints
compared to non-exported functions.
In exported library function signatures (their first line):
The export is mandatory.
The function’s signature must include type keywords to specify the required type for
each parameter.
Programmers can include either the simple or series qualifier keywords to specify the
qualified type each parameter accepts. See the next section for more information.
Exported library functions have the following constraints:
They cannot use variables from the library’s global scope except for those with the
“const” qualifier, meaning they cannot use global variables initialized from script inputs,
for example, or globally declared arrays.
They cannot include calls to any input.*() functions.
They cannot call request.*() functions in their local scopes unless the script includes
dynamic_requests = true in the library() declaration statement. See this section of the
Other timeframes and data page to learn more about dynamic requests.
Library functions always return “simple” or “series” results. Consequently, scripts cannot use
their returned values in locations requiring “const” or “input” values. For example, a library
function cannot calculate an argument for the show_last parameter in a plot() call because
the parameter requires an “input int” qualified type.
Qualified type control
The qualified types of arguments supplied in calls to library functions are autodetected based
on how each argument is used inside the function. If the argument can be used as a “series”,
it is qualified as such. If it cannot, an attempt is made with the “simple” type qualifier. This
explains why this code:
will work when called using myCustomLibrary.myEma(20) , even though ta.ema()‘s length
parameter requires a “simple int” argument. When the Pine Script™ compiler detects that a
“series” length cannot be used with ta.ema(), it tries the “simple” qualifier, which in this case
is allowed.
While library functions cannot return “const” or “input” values, they can be written to produce
“simple” results. This makes them useful in more contexts than functions returning “series”
results, as some built-in functions do not allow “series” arguments. For example,
request.security() requires a “simple string” argument for its symbol parameter when a script
does not allow dynamic requests. If we wrote a library function to assemble the argument to
symbol in the following way, the function’s result would not work with a non-dynamic
request.*() call because it is of the “series string” qualified type:
However, by restricting the parameter qualifiers to “simple”, we can force the function to yield
a “simple” result. We can achieve this by prefixing the parameters’ type with the simple
keyword:
Note that for the function to return a “simple” value, no “series” values can be used in its
calculation; otherwise the result will be a “series” value.
One can also use the series keyword to prefix the type of a library function parameter.
However, because arguments are qualified as “series” by default, using the series modifier is
redundant.
User-defined types and objects
Libraries can export user-defined types (UDTs), and library functions can return objects of
these types.
To export a UDT, prefix its definition with the export keyword, similar to exporting a function:
A script importing that library and creating an object of its point UDT would look somewhat
like this:
Note that:
This code won’t compile because no “Point” library is published, and the script doesn’t
display anything.
userName would need to be replaced by the TradingView user name of the library’s
publisher.
We use the built-in new() method to create an object from the point UDT.
We prefix the reference to the library’s point UDT with the pt alias defined in the
import statement, just like we would when using a function from an imported library.
A library must export a UDT if any exported functions or methods accept or return an object
of that type, or if the fields of another exported UDT accept an instance of the type.
When a library only uses a UDT internally, it does not need to export the type. The following
library uses the point type internally, but it only exports the drawPivots() function, which
does not have a parameter of the point type or return a point object:
If the TradingView user published the above library, it could be used like this:
Enum types
Libraries can also export enum types, allowing other scripts to import sets of predefined,
named values that help control the values accepted by variables, conditional expressions, and
collections.
For example, this library exports a State enum with three fields representing distinct signal
states: long , short , and neutral . These fields represent the possible values a variable,
expression, or collection of the enum type can take on:
A script that imports this library can use the members (values) of the State enum as named
states in its logic. Here, we show a simple, hypothetical script that imports the “Signal” library
published by the userName user and uses the Signal.State enum to assign one of three
possible values to a mySignal variable:
Similar to exporting UDTs, a library must export an enum when its exported functions or
methods accept or return the enum’s members, or when the fields of an exported UDT accept
values of that enum type.
Publishing a library
Before you or other Pine Script™ programmers can reuse any library, it must be published. If
you want to share your library with all TradingViewers, publish it publicly. To use it privately,
use a private publication. As with indicators or strategies, the active chart when you publish a
library will appear in both its widget (the small placeholder denoting libraries in the
TradingView scripts stream) and script page (the page users see when they click on the
widget).
Private libraries can be used in public Protected or Invite-only scripts.
After adding our example library to the chart and setting up a clean chart showing our library
plots the way we want them, we use the Pine Editor’s “Publish Script” button. The “Publish
Library” window comes up:
Note that:
We leave the library’s title as is (the title argument in our library() declaration
statement is used as the default). While you can change the publication’s title, it is
preferable to keep its default value because the title argument is used to reference
imported libraries in the import statement. It makes life easier for library users when
your publication’s title matches the actual name of the library.
A default description is built from the compiler annotations we used in our library. We
will publish the library wihout retouching it.
We chose to publish our library publicly, so it will be visible to all TradingViewers.
We do not have the possibility of selecting a visibility type other than “Open” because
libraries are always open-source.
The list of categories for libraries is different than for indicators and strategies. We have
selected the “Statistics and Metrics” category.
We have added some custom tags: “all-time”, “high” and “low”.
The intended users of public libraries being other Pine programmers; the better you explain
and document your library’s functions, the more chances others will use them. Providing
examples demonstrating how to use your library’s functions in your publication’s code will
also help.
House Rules
Pine libraries are considered “public domain” code in our House Rules on Script Publishing,
which entails that permission is not required from their author if you call their functions or
reuse their code in your open-source scripts. However, if you intend to reuse code from a Pine
Script™ library’s functions in a public protected or invite-only publication, explicit permission
for reuse in that form is required from its author.
Whether using a library’s functions or reusing its code, you must credit the author in your
publication’s description. It is also good form to credit in open-source comments.
Using a library
Using a library from another script (which can be an indicator, a strategy or another library), is
done through the import statement:
where:
The <username>/<libraryName>/<libraryVersion> path will uniquely identify the library.
The <libraryVersion> must be specified explicitly. To ensure the reliability of scripts
using libraries, there is no way to automatically use the latest version of a library. Every
time a library update is published by its author, the library’s version number increases. If
you intend to use the latest version of the library, the <libraryVersion> value will require
updating in the import statement.
The as <alias> part is optional. When used, it defines the namespace that will refer to
the library’s functions. For example, if you import a library using the allTime alias as we
do in the example below, you will refer to that library’s functions as allTime.
<function_mame>() . When no alias is defined, the library’s name becomes its
namespace.
To use the library we published in the previous section, our next script will require an import
statement:
As you type the user name of the library’s author, you can use the Editor’s ctrl + space /
cmd “Auto-complete” command to display a popup providing selections that match the
available libraries:
This is an indicator that reuses our library:
Note that:
We have chosen to use the “allTime” alias for the library’s instance in our script. When
typing that alias in the Editor, a popup will appear to help you select the particular
function you want to use from the library.
We use the library’s hi() and lo() functions without an argument, so the default high
and low built-in variables will be used for their series, respectively.
We use a second call to allTime.hi() , but this time using close as its argument, to plot
the highest close in the chart’s history.

User Manual / Concepts / Lines and boxes Lines and boxes Introduction Pine Script™ facilitates drawing lines, boxes, and other geometric formations from code using the line, box, and polyline types. These types provide utility for programmatically drawing support and resistance levels, trend lines, price ranges, and other custom formations on a chart. Unlike plots, the flexibility of these types makes them particularly well-suited for visualizing current calculated data at virtually any available point on the chart, irrespective of the chart bar the script executes on. Lines, boxes, and polylines are objects, like labels, tables, and other special types. Scripts reference objects of these types using IDs, which act like pointers. As with other objects, line, box, and polyline IDs are qualified as “series” values, and all functions that manage these objects accept “series” arguments. Lines drawn by a script may be vertical, horizontal, or angled. Boxes are always rectangular. Polylines sequentially connect multiple vertical, horizontal, angled, or curved line segments. Although all of these drawing types have different characteristics, they do have some things in common: Lines, boxes, and polylines can have coordinates at any available location on the chart, including ones at future times beyond the last chart bar. Objects of these types can use chart.point instances to set their coordinates. The x-coordinates of each object can be bar index or time values, depending on their specified xloc property. Each object can have one of multiple predefined line styles. Scripts can call the functions that manage these objects from within the scopes of loops and conditional structures, allowing iterative and conditional control of their drawings. There are limits on the number of these objects that a script can reference and display on the chart. A single script instance can display up to 500 lines, 500 boxes, and 100 polylines. Users can specify the maximum number allowed for each type via the max_lines_count , max_boxes_count , and max_polylines_count parameters of the script’s indicator() or strategy() declaration statement. If unspecified, the default is ~50. As with label and table types, lines, boxes, and polylines utilize a garbage collection mechanism that deletes the oldest objects on the chart when the total number of drawings exceeds the script’s limit. Lines The built-ins in the line.* namespace control the creation and management of line objects: The line.new() function creates a new line. The line.set_*() functions modify line properties. The line.get_*() functions retrieve values from a line instance. The line.copy() function clones a line instance. The line.delete() function deletes an existing line instance. The line.all variable references a read-only array containing the IDs of all lines displayed by the script. The array’s size depends on the max_lines_count of the indicator() or strategy() declaration statement and the number of lines the script has drawn. Scripts can call line.set_*() , line.get_*() , line.copy(), and line.delete() built-ins as functions or methods.
Each drawing has a right index length bars beyond the left index. Since the xcoordinates
of these drawings can be up to 500 bars into the future, we’ve set the
maxval of the length input to 500.
On each new period, the script uses randomized color.rgb() values for the
border_color and bgcolor of the boxes.
Each box.new() call copies the coordinates from the chart.point objects assigned to the
topLeft and bottomRight variables, which is why the script can modify their price
fields on each loop iteration without affecting the other boxes.
Cloning boxes
To clone a specific box id , use box.copy(). This function copies the box and its properties.
Any changes to the copied box do not affect the original.
For example, this script declares an originalBox variable on the first bar and assigns a new
box to it once every length bars. On other bars, it uses box.copy() to create a copiedBox
and calls box.set_*() functions to modify its properties. As shown on the chart below, these
changes do not modify the originalBox :
Deleting boxes
To delete boxes drawn by a script, use box.delete(). As with *.delete() functions in other
drawing namespaces, this function is handy for conditionally removing boxes or maintaining a
specific number of boxes on the chart.
This example displays boxes representing periodic cumulative volume values. The script
creates a new box ID and stores it in a boxes array once every length bars. If the array’s
size exceeds the specified numberOfBoxes , the script removes the oldest box from the array
using array.shift() and deletes it using box.delete().
On other bars, it accumulates volume over each period by modifying the top of the last box
in the boxes array. The script then uses for loops to find the highestTop of all the array’s
boxes and set the bgcolor of each box with a gradient color based on its box.get_top() value
relative to the highestTop :
Note that:
At the top of the code, we’ve declared a MAX_BOXES_COUNT variable with the “const int”
qualified type. We use this value as the max_boxes_count in the indicator() function and
the maximum possible value of the numberOfBoxes input.
This script uses the second overload of the box.new() function, which specifies the
box’s left , top , right , and bottom coordinates separately.
We’ve included format.volume as the format argument in the indicator() call, which
tells the script that the y-axis of the chart pane represents volume values. Each box also
displays its top value as volume-formatted text.
Polylines
Pine Script™ polylines are advanced drawings that sequentially connect the coordinates from
an array of chart.point instances using straight or curved line segments.
These powerful drawings can connect up to 10,000 points at any available location on the
chart, allowing scripts to draw custom series, polygons, and other complex geometric
formations that are otherwise difficult or impossible to draw using line or box objects.
The polyline.* namespace features the following built-ins for creating and managing
polyline objects:
The polyline.new() function creates a new polyline instance.
The polyline.delete() function deletes an existing polyline instance.
The polyline.all variable references a read-only array containing the IDs of all polylines
displayed by the script. The array’s size depends on the max_polylines_count of the
indicator() or strategy() declaration statement and the number of polylines drawn by the
script.
Unlike lines or boxes, polylines do not have functions for modification or reading their
properties. To redraw a polyline on the chart, one can delete the existing instance and create
a new polyline with the desired changes.
Creating polylines
The polyline.new() function creates a new polyline instance to display on the chart. It has the
following signature:
The following eight parameters affect the behavior of a polyline drawing:
points
Accepts an array of chart.point objects that determine the coordinates of each point in the
polyline. The drawing connects the coordinates from each element in the array
sequentially, starting from the first. Whether the polyline uses the index or time field
from each chart point for its x-coordinates depends on the xloc value in the function call.
curved
Specifies whether the drawing uses curved line segments to connect each chart.point in
the points array. The default value is false , meaning it uses straight line segments.
closed
Controls whether the polyline will connect the last chart.point in the points array to the
first, forming a closed polyline. The default value is false .
xloc
Specifies which field from each chart.point in the points array the polyline uses for its xcoordinates.
When its value is xloc.bar_index, the function uses the index fields to create
the polyline. When its value is xloc.bar_time, the function uses the time fields. The default
value is xloc.bar_index.
line_color
Specifies the color of all line segments in the polyline drawing. The default is color.blue .
fill_color
Controls the color of the closed space filled by the polyline drawing. Its default value is na.
line_style
Specifies the style of the polyline, which can be any of the available options in the Line
styles section of this page. The default is line.style_solid.
line_width
Specifies the width of the polyline, in pixels. The default value is 1.
force_overlay
If true , the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a
separate pane. Optional. The default is false .
This script demonstrates a simple example of drawing a polyline on the chart. It pushes a new
chart.point with an alternating price value into a points array and colors the background
with bgcolor() once every length bars.
On the last confirmed historical bar, the script draws a new polyline on the chart, connecting
the coordinates from each chart point in the array, starting from the first:
Note that:
This script uses only one polyline to connect each chart point from the array with
straight line segments, and this drawing spans throughout the available chart data,
starting from the first bar.
While one can achieve a similar effect using lines, doing so would require a new line
instance on each occurrence of the newPoint condition, and such a drawing would be
limited to a maximum of 500 line segments. This single unclosed polyline drawing, on
the other hand, can contain up to 9,999 line segments.
Curved drawings
Polylines can draw curves that are otherwise impossible to produce with lines or boxes. When
enabling the curved parameter of the polyline.new() function, the resulting polyline
interpolates nonlinear values between the coordinates from each chart.point in its array of
points to generate a curvy effect.
For instance, the “Oscillating polyline” script in our previous example uses straight line
segments to produce a drawing resembling a triangle wave, meaning a waveform that zigzags
between its peaks and valleys. If we set the curved parameter in the polyline.new() call
from that example to true , the resulting drawing would connect the points using curved
segments, producing a smooth, nonlinear shape similar to a sine wave:
Notice that in this example, the smooth curves have relatively consistent behavior, and no
portion of the drawing extends past its defined coordinates, which is not always the case
when drawing curved polylines. The data used to construct a polyline heavily impacts the
smooth, piecewise function it interpolates between its points. In some cases, the interpolated
curve can reach beyond its actual coordinates.
Let’s add some variation to the chart points in our example’s points array to demonstrate
this behavior. In the version below, the script multiplies the yValue by a random value in the
chart.point.now() calls.
To visualize the behavior, this script also creates a horizontal line at the price value from
each chart.point in the points array, and it displays another polyline connecting the same
points with straight line segments. As we see on the chart, both polylines pass through all
coordinates from the points array. However, the curvy polyline occasionally reaches beyond
the vertical boundaries indicated by the horizontal lines, whereas the polyline drawn using
straight segments does not:
Closed shapes
Since a single polyline can contain numerous straight or curved line segments, and the
closed parameter allows the drawing to connect the coordinates from the first and last
chart.point in its array of points , we can use polylines to draw many different types of
closed polygonal shapes.
Let’s draw some polygons in Pine. The following script periodically draws randomized
polygons centered at hl2 price values.
On each occurrence of the newPolygon condition, it clears the points array, calculates the
numberOfSides and rotationOffset of the new polygon drawing based on math.random()
values, then uses a for loop to push numberOfSides new chart points into the array that
contain stepped coordinates from an elliptical path with xScale and yScale semi-axes. The
script draws the polygon by connecting each chart.point from the points array using a
closed polyline with straight line segments:
Note that:
This example shows the last ~50 polylines on the chart, as we have not specified a
max_polylines_count value in the indicator() function call.
The yScale calculation multiplies an input.float() by ta.atr(2) to adapt the vertical scale
of the drawings to recent price ranges.
The resulting polygons have a maximum width of twice the horizontal semi-axis ( 2 *
xScale ), rounded to the nearest integer. The newPolygon condition uses this value to
prevent the polygon drawings from overlapping.
The script rounds the xValue calculation to the nearest integer because the index
field of a chart.point only accepts an int value, as the x-axis of the chart does not
include fractional bar indices.
Deleting polylines
To delete a specific polyline id , use polyline.delete(). This function removes the polyline
object from the script and its drawing on the chart.
As with other drawing objects, we can use polyline.delete() to maintain a specific number of
polyline drawings or conditionally remove drawings from a chart.
For example, the script below periodically draws approximate arithmetic spirals and stores
their polyline IDs in an array, which it uses as a queue to manage the number of drawings it
displays.
When the newSpiral condition occurs, the script creates a points array and adds chart
points within a for loop. On each loop iteration, it calls the spiralPoint() user-defined
function to create a new chart.point containing stepped values from an elliptical path that
grows with respect to the angle . The script then creates a randomly colored curved polyline
connecting the coordinates from the points and pushes its ID into the polylines array.
When the array’s size exceeds the specified numberOfSpirals , the script removes the oldest
polyline using array.shift() and deletes the object using polyline.delete():
Note that:
We declared a MAX_POLYLINES_COUNT global variable with a constant value of 100. The
script uses this constant as the max_polylines_count value in the indicator() function
and the maxval of the numberOfSpirals input.
As with our “N-sided polygons” example in the previous section, we round the
calculation of x-coordinates to the nearest integer since the index field of a chart.point
can only accept an int value.
Despite the smooth appearance of the drawings, each polyline’s points array only
contains four chart.point objects per spiral rotation. Since the polyline.new() call
includes curved = true , each polyline uses smooth curves to connect their points ,
producing a visual approximation of the spiral’s actual curvature.
The width of each spiral is approximately 4 * math.pi * rotations * xScale , rounded
to the nearest integer. We use this value in the newSpiral condition to space each
drawing and prevent overlaps.
Redrawing polylines
It may be desirable in some cases to change a polyline drawing throughout a script’s
execution. While the polyline.* namespace does not contain built-in setter functions, we
can redraw polylines referenced by variables or collections by deleting the existing polylines
and assigning new instances with the desired changes.
The following example uses polyline.delete() and polyline.new() calls to update the value of a
polyline variable.
This script draws closed polylines that connect the open, high, low, and close points of
periods containing length bars. It creates a currentDrawing variable on the first bar and
assigns a polyline ID to it on every chart bar. It uses the openPoint , highPoint , lowPoint ,
and closePoint variables to reference chart points that track the period’s developing OHLC
values. As new values emerge, the script assigns new chart.point objects to the variables,
collects them in an array using array.from, then creates a new polyline connecting the
coordinates from the array’s points and assigns it to the currentDrawing .
When the newPeriod condition is false (i.e., the current period is not complete), the script
deletes the polyline referenced by the currentDrawing before creating a new one, resulting in
a dynamic drawing that changes over the developing period:
Realtime behavior
Lines, boxes, and polylines are subject to both commit and rollback actions, which affect the
behavior of a script when it executes on a realtime bar. See the page on Pine Script™‘s
Execution model.
This script demonstrates the effect of rollback when it executes on the realtime, unconfirmed
chart bar:
The line.new() call in this example creates a new line ID on each iteration when values change
on the unconfirmed bar. The script automatically deletes the objects created on each change
in that bar because of the rollback before each iteration. It only commits the last line created
before the bar closes, and that line instance is the one that persists on the confirmed bar.
Limitations
Total number of objects
Lines, boxes, and polylines consume server resources, which is why there are limits on the
total number of drawings per script. When a script creates more drawing objects than the
allowed limit, the Pine Script™ runtime automatically deletes the oldest ones in a process
referred to as garbage collection.
A single script can contain up to 500 lines, 500 boxes, and 100 polylines. Users can control
the garbage collection limits by specifying the max_lines_count , max_boxes_count , and
max_polylines_count values in their script’s indicator() or strategy() declaration statement.
This script demonstrates how garbage collection works in Pine. It creates a new line, box, and
polyline on each chart bar. We haven’t specified values for the max_lines_count ,
max_boxes_count , or max_polylines_count parameters in the indicator() function call, so the
script will maintain the most recent ~50 lines, boxes, and polylines on the chart, as this is the
default setting for each parameter:
Note that:
We’ve used TradingView’s “Measure” drawing tool to measure the number of bars
covered by the script’s drawing objects.
Future references with `xloc.bar_index`
Objects positioned using xloc.bar_index can contain x-coordinates no further than 500 bars
into the future.
Other contexts
Scripts cannot use lines, boxes, or polylines in request.*() functions. Instances of these
types can use the values from request.*() calls, but scripts can only create and draw them
in the chart’s context.
This limitation is also why drawing objects will not work when using the timeframe parameter
in the indicator() declaration statement.
Historical buffer and `max_bars_back`
Using barstate.isrealtime in combination with drawings may sometimes produce unexpected
results. For example, the intention of this script is to ignore all historical bars and draw
horizontal lines spanning 300 bars back on realtime bars:
However, it will fail at runtime and raise an error. The script fails because it cannot determine
the buffer size for historical values of the underlying time series. Although the code doesn’t
contain the built-in time variable, the built-in bar_index uses the time series in its inner
workings. Therefore, accessing the value of the bar_index from 300 bars back requires the
history buffer of the time series to be at least 300 bars.
Pine Script™ includes a mechanism that detects the required historical buffer size
automatically in most cases. It works by letting the script access historical values any number
of bars back for a limited duration. In this script’s case, using barstate.isrealtime to control the
drawing of lines prevents it from accessing the historical series, so it cannot infer the required
historical buffer size, and the script fails.
The simple solution to this issue is to use the max_bars_back() function to explicitly define
the historical buffer of the time series before evaluating the conditional structure:
Such issues can be confusing, but they’re quite rare. The Pine Script™ team hopes to
eliminate them over time.

Non-standard charts data
Notice! Using the types we discuss on this page often involves arrays, especially when working with polylines, which require an array of chart.point instances. We therefore recommend you become familiar with arrays to make the most of these drawing types in your scripts. Notice! On TradingView charts, a complete set of Drawing Tools allows users to create and modify drawings using mouse actions. While they may sometimes resemble drawing objects created with Pine Script™ code, they are unrelated entities. Pine scripts cannot interact with drawing tools from the chart user interface, and mouse actions do not directly affect Pine drawing objects.

Non-standard charts data
Introduction
These functions allow scripts to fetch information from non-standard bars or chart types,
regardless of the type of chart the script is running on. They are: ticker.heikinashi(),
ticker.renko(), ticker.linebreak(), ticker.kagi() and ticker.pointfigure(). All of them work in the
same manner; they create a special ticker identifier to be used as the first argument in a
request.security() function call.
`ticker.heikinashi()`
Heikin-Ashi means average bar in Japanese. The open/high/low/close values of Heikin-Ashi
candlesticks are synthetic; they are not actual market prices. They are calculated by
averaging combinations of real OHLC values from the current and previous bar. The
calculations used make Heikin-Ashi bars less noisy than normal candlesticks. They can be
useful to make visual assessments, but are unsuited to backtesting or automated trading, as
orders execute on market prices — not Heikin-Ashi prices.
The ticker.heikinashi() function creates a special ticker identifier for requesting Heikin-Ashi
data with the request.security() function.
This script requests the close value of Heikin-Ashi bars and plots them on top of the normal
candlesticks:
Note that:
The close values for Heikin-Ashi bars plotted as the black line are very different from
those of real candles using market prices. They act more like a moving average.
The black line appears over the chart bars because we have selected “Visual
Order/Bring to Front” from the script’s “More” menu.
If you wanted to omit values for extended hours in the last example, an intermediary ticker
without extended session information would need to be created first:
Note that:
We use the ticker.new() function first, to create a ticker without extended session
information.
We use that ticker instead of syminfo.tickerid in our ticker.heikinashi() call.
In our request.security() call, we set the gaps parameter’s value to barmerge.gaps_on .
This instructs the function not to use previous values to fill slots where data is absent.
This makes it possible for it to return na values outside of regular sessions.
To be able to see this on the chart, we also need to use a special plot.style_linebr
style, which breaks the plots on na values.
This script plots Heikin-Ashi candles under the chart:
Note that:
We use a tuple with request.security() to fetch four values with the same call.
We use plotcandle() to plot our candles. See the Bar plotting page for more information.
`ticker.renko()`
Renko bars only plot price movements, without taking time or volume into consideration. They
look like bricks stacked in adjacent columns1. A new brick is only drawn after the price passes
the top or bottom by a predetermined amount. The ticker.renko() function creates a ticker id
which can be used with request.security() to fetch Renko values, but there is no Pine Script™
function to draw Renko bars on the chart:
`ticker.linebreak()`
The Line Break chart type displays a series of vertical boxes that are based on price changes1.
The ticker.linebreak() function creates a ticker id which can be used with request.security() to
fetch “Line Break” values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to draw such bars on the
chart:
`ticker.kagi()`
Kagi charts are made of a continuous line that changes directions. The direction changes
when the price changes1 beyond a predetermined amount. The ticker.kagi() function creates
a ticker id which can be used with request.security() to fetch “Kagi” values, but there is no
Pine Script™ function to draw such bars on the chart:
`ticker.pointfigure()`
Point and Figure (PnF) charts only plot price movements1, without taking time into
consideration. A column of X’s is plotted as the price rises, and O’s are plotted when price
drops. The ticker.pointfigure() function creates a ticker id which can be used with
request.security() to fetch “PnF” values, but there is no Pine Script™ function to draw such
bars on the chart. Every column of X’s or O’s is represented with four numbers. You may think
of them as synthetic OHLC PnF values:

User Manual / Concepts / Other timeframes and data Other timeframes and data Introduction Pine Script™ allows users to request data from sources and contexts other than those their charts use. The functions we present on this page can fetch data from a variety of alternative sources: request.security() retrieves data from another symbol, timeframe, or other context. request.security_lower_tf() retrieves intrabar data, i.e., data from a timeframe lower than the chart timeframe. request.currency_rate() requests a daily rate to convert a value expressed in one currency to another. request.dividends(), request.splits(), and request.earnings() respectively retrieve information about an issuing company’s dividends, splits, and earnings. request.quandl() retrieves information from NASDAQ Data Link (formerly Quandl). request.financial() retrieves financial data from FactSet. request.economic() retrieves economic and industry data. request.seed() retrieves data from a user-maintained GitHub repository. These are the signatures of the functions in the request.* namespace: The request.*() family of functions has numerous potential applications. Throughout this page, we discuss in detail these functions and some of their typical use cases. Common characteristics Many functions in the request.*() namespace share some common properties and parameters. Before we explore each function in depth, let’s familiarize ourselves with these characteristics. Behavior All request.*() functions have similar internal behavior, even though they do not all share the same required parameters. Every unique request.*() call in a script requests a dataset from a defined context (i.e., ticker ID and timeframe) and evaluates an expression across the retrieved data. The request.security() and request.security_lower_tf() functions allow programmers to specify the context of a request and the expression directly via the symbol , timeframe , and expression parameters, making them suitable for a wide range of data requests. For example, the request.security() call in this simple script requests daily “AMEX:SPY” data, and it calculates the slope of a 20-bar linear regression line using the retrieved hl2 prices. The first two arguments specify the context of the request, and the third specifies the expression to evaluate across the requested data: Other functions within the request.*() namespace do not allow programmers to directly define the full context of a request or the evaluated expression. Instead, these functions determine some of the necessary information internally because they perform only specific types of requests. For instance, request.financial() exclusively retrieves periodic financial data. Its required parameters ( symbol , financial_id , and period ) all define parts of a specific financial ticker ID. The function does not allow specification of the timeframe or expression, as it determines these details internally. The script below demonstrates a simple call to this function that retrieves the annual cost of goods data for the chart symbol’s issuing company: Scripts can perform up to 40 unique requests using any combination of request.*() function calls. Only unique request.*() calls count toward this limit because they are the only calls that fetch new data. Redundant calls to the same request.*() function with identical arguments do not retrieve new data. Instead, they reuse the data from the first executed call. See this section of the Limitations page for more information. `gaps` When using a request.*() function to retrieve data from another context, the data may not come in on each new bar as it would with the current chart. The gaps parameter of a request.*() function controls how the function responds to nonexistent values in the requested series. Suppose we have a script executing on an 1-minute chart that requests hourly data for the chart’s symbol using request.security(). The function call returns new values only on the 1- minute bars that cover the opening and closing times of the symbol’s hourly bars. On other chart bars, we can decide whether the function returns na values or the last available values via the gaps parameter. When the gaps parameter uses barmerge.gaps_on, the function returns na results on all chart bars where new data is not yet confirmed from the requested context. Otherwise, when the parameter uses barmerge.gaps_off, the function fills the gaps in the requested data with the last confirmed values on historical bars and the most recent developing values on realtime bars. The script below demonstrates the difference in behavior by plotting the results from two request.security() calls that fetch the close price of the current symbol from the hourly timeframe on a 1-minute chart. The first call uses gaps = barmerge.gaps_off and the second uses gaps = barmerge.gaps_on : Note that: barmerge.gaps_off is the default value for the gaps parameter in all applicable request.*() functions. The script plots the requested series as lines with breaks (plot.style_linebr), which do not bridge over na values as the default style (plot.style_line) does. When using barmerge.gaps_off, the request.security() function returns the last confirmed close from the hourly timeframe on all historical bars. When running on realtime bars (the bars with the color.aqua background in this example), it returns the symbol’s current close value, regardless of confirmation. For more information, see the Historical and realtime behavior section of this page. `ignore_invalid_symbol` The ignore_invalid_symbol parameter of request.*() functions determines how a function handles invalid data requests, e.g.: Using a request.*() function with a nonexistent ticker ID as the symbol/ticker parameter. Using request.financial() to retrieve information that does not exist for the specified symbol or period . Using request.economic() to request a field that does not exist for a country_code . A request.*() function call produces a runtime error and halts the execution of the script when making an erroneous request if its ignore_invalid_symbol parameter is false . When this parameter’s value is true , the function returns na values in such a case instead of raising an error. This example uses request.*() calls within a user-defined function to retrieve data for estimating an instrument’s market capitalization (market cap). The user-defined calcMarketCap() function calls request.financial() to retrieve the total shares outstanding for a symbol and request.security() to retrieve a tuple containing the symbol’s close price and currency. We’ve included ignore_invalid_symbol = true in both of these request.*() calls to prevent runtime errors for invalid requests. The script displays a formatted string representing the symbol’s estimated market cap value and currency in a table on the chart and uses a plot to visualize the marketCap history: Note that: The calcMarketCap() function only returns non-na values on valid instruments with total shares outstanding data, such as the one we selected for this example. It returns na on others that do not have financial data, including forex, crypto, and derivatives. Not all issuing companies publish quarterly financial reports. If the issuing company of the symbol does not report on a quarterly basis, change the “FQ” value in this script to the company’s minimum reporting period. See the request.financial() section for more information. We included format.volume in the indicator() and str.tostring() calls to specify that the y- axis of the chart pane represents volume-formatted values and the “string” representation of the marketCap value shows as volume-formatted text. This script creates a table and initializes its cell on the first chart bar, then updates the cell’s text on the last chart bar. To learn more about working with tables, see the Tables page. `currency` The currency parameter of a request.*() function allows users to specify the currency of the requested data. When this parameter’s value differs from the syminfo.currency of the symbol, the function converts the requested values to express them in the specified currency . This parameter accepts a built-in variable from the currency.* namespace, such as currency.JPY, or a “string” representing a valid currency code (e.g., “JPY”). If a script allows dynamic requests, this parameter allows a “series” argument that can change across executions. Otherwise, it accepts a value with a “simple” or weaker qualifier. The conversion rate between the syminfo.currency of the requested data and the specified currency depends on the previous daily value of the corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. If no exchange provides the rate directly, the function derives the rate using a spread symbol. `lookahead` The lookahead parameter in request.security(), request.dividends(), request.splits(), and request.earnings() specifies the lookahead behavior of the function call. Its default value is barmerge.lookahead_off. When requesting data from a higher-timeframe (HTF) context, the lookahead value determines whether the request.*() function can return values from times beyond those of the historical bars it executes on. In other words, the lookahead paremeter determines whether the requested data may contain lookahead bias on historical bars. When requesting data from a lower-timeframe (LTF) context, the lookahead parameter determines whether the function requests values from the first or last intrabar (LTF bar) of each chart-timeframe bar. Programmers should exercise extreme caution when using lookahead in their requests, namely when requesting data from higher timeframes. When using barmerge.lookahead_on as the lookahead value, ensure that it does not compromise the integrity of the script’s logic by leaking future data into historical chart bars. The following scenarios are cases where enabling lookahead is acceptable in a request.*() call: The expression in request.security() references a series with a historical offset (e.g., close[1] ), which prevents the function from requesting future values that it would not have access to on a realtime basis. The specified timeframe in the call is the same as the chart the script executes on, i.e., timeframe.period. The function call requests data from an intrabar timeframe, i.e., a timeframe smaller than the timeframe.period. See this section for more information. This example demonstrates how the lookahead parameter affects the behavior of higher- timeframe data requests and why enabling lookahead in request.security() without offsetting the expression is misleading. The script calls request.security() to get the HTF high price for the current chart’s symbol in three different ways and plots the resulting series on the chart for comparison. The first call uses barmerge.lookahead_off (default), and the others use barmerge.lookahead_on. However, the third request.security() call also offsets its expression using the history-referencing operator [] to avoid leaking future data into the past. As we see on the chart, the plot of the series requested using barmerge.lookahead_on without an offset (fuchsia line) shows final HTF high prices before they are actually available on historical bars, whereas the other two calls do not: Note that: The series requested using barmerge.lookahead_off has a new historical value at the end of each HTF period, and both series requested using barmerge.lookahead_on have new historical data at the start of each period. On realtime bars, the plot of the series without lookahead (blue) and the series with lookahead and no historical offset (fuchsia) show the same value (i.e., the HTF period’s unconfirmed high price), as no data exists beyond those points to leak into the past. Both of these plots repaint their results after restarting the script’s executions, as realtime bars become historical bars. The series that uses lookahead and a historical offset (aqua) does not repaint its values, as it always references the last confirmed value from the higher timeframe. See the Avoiding repainting section of this page for more information. Dynamic requests By default, unlike all previous Pine Script™ versions, all v6 script’s request.*() functions are dynamic. In contrast to non-dynamic requests, dynamic requests can: Access data from different data feeds using a single request.*() instance with “series” arguments. Execute within the local scopes of conditional structures, loops, and exported functions. Execute nested requests. Aside from the features described above, there are insignificant differences in the behavior of regular and dynamic security. Still, for backwards compatibility, this behavior can be turned off by specifying dynamic_requests = false in the indicator(), strategy(), or library() declaration statement. ”series” arguments Scripts without dynamic requests enabled cannot use “series” arguments for most request.* () function parameters, which means the argument values cannot change. The only exception is the expression parameter in request.security(), request.security_lower_tf(), and request.seed(), which always allows “series” values. In contrast, when a script allows dynamic requests, all request.*() function parameters that define parts of the ticker ID or timeframe of a request accept “series” arguments that can change with each script execution. In other words, with dynamic requests, it’s possible for a single request.*() instance to fetch data from different contexts in different executions. Some other optional parameters, such as ignore_invalid_symbol , can also accept “series” arguments, allowing additional flexibility in request.*() call behaviors. The following script declares a symbolSeries variable that is assigned four different symbol strings in 20-bar cycles, with its value changing after every five bars. The request.security() call uses this variable as the symbol argument. The script plots the requestedClose values, which therefore represent a different symbol’s close prices for each five-bar period. Note that: The script draws a label every time the symbolSeries changes, to signify which symbol’s data the requestedClose currently represents. Removing dynamic_requests = true from this script’s declaration statement causes a compilation error. Scripts without dynamic requests enabled cannot use “series string” symbol arguments in request.security() calls. An important limitation is that when using dynamic request.*() calls with “series” arguments or within local scopes, scripts must request all required datasets while executing on historical bars. All request.*() calls on realtime bars can retrieve data from the datasets that the script previously accessed on historical bars, but they cannot request a new context or evaluate a new expression. To illustrate this limitation, let’s revisit the above script. Notice that it requests close data for all four symbols on the chart’s timeframe during its historical executions. The external datasets for those four contexts are the only ones that any request.*() call on realtime bars can access. Below, we changed the timeframe argument in the script’s request.security() call to specify that it requests symbolSeries data from the chart’s timeframe on historical bars and the “240” (240 minutes = 4H) timeframe on realtime bars. This version raises a runtime error on the first realtime tick, if it is run on any timeframe other than the 4H timeframe, because it cannot access the 4H data feeds without requesting them on historical bars first: In local scopes When scripts do not allow dynamic requests, all request.*() calls execute once on every bar or realtime tick, which prevents their use within most local scopes. The only exception is for request.*() calls in the scopes of non-exported functions and methods, because the Pine Script™ compiler extracts such calls into the global scope during translation. Scripts that allow dynamic requests do not restrict the execution of request.*() calls to the global scope. They can call request.*() functions directly within the scopes of conditional structures and loops, meaning that each request.*() instance in the code can activate zero, one, or several times on each script execution. The following example uses a single request.security() instance within a loop to request data from multiple forex data feeds. The script declares an array of symbols on the first chart bar, which it iterates through on all bars using a for…in loop. Each loop iteration calls request.security() to retrieve the volume value for one of the symbols and pushes the result into the requestedData array. After the loop terminates, the script calculates the average, maximum, and minimum values from the requestedData array and plots those values on the chart: Notice that the expression argument in the above example (volume) is loop-invariant, i.e., it does not change on any loop iteration. When using request.*() calls within a loop, all parameters defining parts of the requested context can accept arguments that depend on variables from the loop’s header or mutable variables that change within the loop’s local scope. However, a request.*() call’s evaluated expression cannot depend on the values of those variables. Here, we modified the above script to use the second form of the for…in loop statement, which creates a tuple containing the index and value of each element in the symbols array. The request.security() instance in this version uses the index ( i ) in its expression argument, resulting in a compilation error: In libraries Libraries with dynamic requests enabled can export functions and methods that utilize request.*() calls within their local scopes, provided that the evaluated expressions do not depend on any exported function parameters. For example, this simple library exports an htfPrices() function that requests a tuple of confirmed open, high, low, and close prices using a specified tickerID and timeframe . If we publish this library, another script can import the function to request higher-timeframe prices without explicitly calling request.security(). Note that: The tuple that the request.security() call includes as the expression argument does not depend on the htfPrices() parameters. The htfPrices() function raises a custom runtime error when the timeframe argument is not higher than the chart’s timeframe. See the higher timeframes section for more information. The request.security() call uses barmerge.lookahead_on and offsets each item in the tuple by one bar. This is the only recommended method to avoid repainting. Nested requests Scripts that include dynamic_requests = true can execute nested requests, i.e., request.* () calls that dynamically evaluate other request.*() calls that their expression arguments depend on. When a request.security() or request.security_lower_tf() call uses an empty string or syminfo.tickerid for its symbol argument, or if it uses an empty string or timeframe.period for the timeframe argument, the requested ticker ID or timeframe depends on the context where the call executes. This context is normally the ticker ID or timeframe of the chart that the script is running on. However, if such a request.security() or request.security_lower_tf() function call is evaluated by another request.*() call, the nested request inherits that request.*() call’s ticker ID or timeframe information. For example, the script below contains two request.security() calls and uses Pine Logs to display their results. The first call uses empty strings as its symbol and timeframe arguments, meaning that the requested context depends on where the call executes. It evaluates a concatenated string containing the call’s requested ticker ID and timeframe, and the script assigns its result to the info1 variable. The second call requests data for a specific symbol and timeframe using the info1 variable as its expression argument. Since the info1 variable depends on the first request.security() call, the second call evaluates the first call within its own context. Therefore, the first call adopts the second call’s ticker ID and timeframe while executing within that context, resulting in a different returned value: This script allows the execution of the first request.security() call within the context of the second call because we included dynamic_requests = true in the indicator() declaration statement. Without dynamic requests enabled, the script evaluates each call independently, passing the first call’s calculated value directly into the second call rather than executing the first call within the second context. Consequently, the second call’s returned value is the same as the first call’s value, as we see below: Data feeds TradingView’s data providers supply different data feeds that scripts can access to retrieve information about an instrument, including: Intraday historical data (for timeframes < 1D) End-of-day (EOD) historical data (for timeframes >= 1D) Realtime data (which may be delayed, depending on your account type and extra data services) Extended hours data Not all of these data feed types exist for every instrument. For example, the symbol “BNC:BLX” only has EOD data available. For some instruments with intraday and EOD historical feeds, volume data may not be the same since some trades (block trades, OTC trades, etc.) may only be available at the end of the trading day. Consequently, the EOD feed will include this volume data, but the intraday feed will not. Differences between EOD and intraday volume feeds are almost nonexistent for instruments such as cryptocurrencies, but they are commonplace in stocks. Slight price discrepancies may also occur between EOD and intraday feeds. For example, the high value on one EOD bar may not match any intraday high values supplied by the data provider for that day. Another distinction between EOD and intraday data feeds is that EOD feeds do not contain information from extended hours. When retrieving information on realtime bars with request.*() functions, it’s important to note that historical and realtime data reported for an instrument often rely on different data feeds. A broker/exchange may retroactively modify values reported on realtime bars, which the data will only reflect after refreshing the chart or restarting the script. Another important consideration is that the chart’s data feeds and feeds requested from providers by the script are managed by independent, concurrent processes. Consequently, in some rare cases, it’s possible for races to occur where requested results temporarily fall out of synch with the chart on a realtime bar, which a script retroactively adjusts after restarting its executions. These points may account for variations in the values retrieved by request.*() functions when requesting data from other contexts. They may also result in discrepancies between data received on realtime bars and historical bars. There are no steadfast rules about the variations one may encounter in their requested data feeds. When using data feeds requested from other contexts, it’s also crucial to consider the time axis differences between the chart the script executes on and the requested feeds since request.*() functions adapt the returned series to the chart’s time axis. For example, requesting “BTCUSD” data on the “SPY” chart with request.security() will only show new values when the “SPY” chart has new data as well. Since “SPY” is not a 24-hour symbol, the “BTCUSD” data returned will contain gaps that are otherwise not present when viewing its chart directly. `request.security()` The request.security() function allows scripts to request data from other contexts than the chart the script executes on, such as: Other symbols, including spread symbols Other timeframes (see our User Manual’s page on Timeframes to learn about timeframe specifications in Pine Script™) Custom contexts, including alternative sessions, price adjustments, chart types, etc. using ticker.*() functions This is the function’s signature: The symbol value is the ticker identifier representing the symbol to fetch data from. This parameter accepts values in any of the following formats: A “string” representing a symbol (e.g., “IBM” or “EURUSD”) or an “Exchange:Symbol” pair (e.g., “NYSE:IBM” or “OANDA:EURUSD”). When the value does not contain an exchange prefix, the function selects the exchange automatically. We recommend specifying the exchange prefix when possible for consistent results. Users can also pass an empty string to this parameter, which prompts the function to use the current chart’s symbol. A “string” representing a spread symbol (e.g., “AMD/INTC”). Note that “Bar Replay” mode does not work with these symbols. The syminfo.ticker or syminfo.tickerid built-in variables, which return the symbol or the “Exchange:Symbol” pair that the current chart references. We recommend using syminfo.tickerid to avoid ambiguity unless the exchange information does not matter in the data request. For more information on syminfo.* variables, see this section of our Chart information page. A custom ticker identifier created using ticker.*() functions. Ticker IDs constructed from these functions may contain additional settings for requesting data using non- standard chart calculations, alternative sessions, and other contexts. See the Custom contexts section for more information. The timeframe value specifies the timeframe of the requested data. This parameter accepts “string” values in our timeframe specification format (e.g., a value of “1D” represents the daily timeframe). To request data from the same timeframe as the chart the script executes on, use the timeframe.period variable or an empty string. The expression parameter of the request.security() function determines the data it retrieves from the specified context. This versatile parameter accepts “series” values of int, float, bool, color, string, and chart.point types. It can also accept tuples, collections, user-defined types, and the outputs of function and method calls. For more details on the data one can retrieve, see the Requestable data section below. Timeframes The request.security() function can request data from any available timeframe, regardless of the chart the script executes on. The timeframe of the data retrieved depends on the timeframe argument in the function call, which may represent a higher timeframe (e.g., using “1D” as the timeframe value while running the script on an intraday chart) or the chart’s timeframe (i.e., using timeframe.period or an empty string as the timeframe argument). Scripts can also request limited data from lower timeframes with request.security() (e.g., using “1” as the timeframe argument while running the script on a 60-minute chart). However, we don’t typically recommend using this function for LTF data requests. The request.security_lower_tf() function is more optimal for such cases. Higher timeframes Most use cases of request.security() involve requesting data from a timeframe higher than or the same as the chart timeframe. For example, this script retrieves the hl2 price from a requested higherTimeframe . It plots the resulting series on the chart alongside the current chart’s hl2 for comparison: Note that: We’ve included an offset to the expression argument and used barmerge.lookahead_on in request.security() to ensure the series returned behaves the same on historical and realtime bars. See the Avoiding repainting section for more information. Notice that in the above example, it is possible to select a higherTimeframe value that actually represents a lower timeframe than the one the chart uses, as the code does not prevent it. When designing a script to work specifically with higher timeframes, we recommend including conditions to prevent it from accessing lower timeframes, especially if you intend to publish it. Below, we’ve added an if structure to our previous example that raises a runtime error when the higherTimeframe input represents a timeframe smaller than the chart timeframe, effectively preventing the script from requesting LTF data: Lower timeframes Although the request.security() function is intended to operate on timeframes greater than or equal to the chart timeframe, it can request data from lower timeframes as well, with limitations. When calling this function to access a lower timeframe, it will evaluate the expression from the LTF context. However, it can only return the results from a single intrabar (LTF bar) on each chart bar. The intrabar that the function returns data from on each historical chart bar depends on the lookahead value in the function call. When using barmerge.lookahead_on, it will return the first available intrabar from the chart period. When using barmerge.lookahead_off, it will return the last intrabar from the chart period. On realtime bars, it returns the last available value of the expression from the timeframe, regardless of the lookahead value, as the realtime intrabar information retrieved by the function is not yet sorted. This script retrieves close data from the valid timeframe closest to a fourth of the size of the chart timeframe. It makes two calls to request.security() with different lookahead values. The first call uses barmerge.lookahead_on to access the first intrabar value in each chart bar. The second uses the default lookahead value (barmerge.lookahead_off), which requests the last intrabar value assigned to each chart bar. The script plots the outputs of both calls on the chart to compare the difference: Note that: The script determines the value of the lowerTimeframe by calculating the number of seconds in the chart timeframe with timeframe.in_seconds(), then dividing by four and converting the result to a valid timeframe string via timeframe.from_seconds(). The plot of the series without lookahead (purple) aligns with the close value on the chart timeframe, as this is the last intrabar value in the chart bar. Both request.security() calls return the same value (the current close) on each realtime bar, as shown on the bars with the orange background. Scripts can retrieve up to 200,000 intrabars from a lower-timeframe context. The number of chart bars with available intrabar data varies with the requested lower timeframe, the calc_bars_count value, and the user’s plan. See this section of the Limitations page. Requestable data The request.security() function is quite versatile, as it can retrieve values of any fundamental type (int, float, bool, color, or string). It can also request the IDs of data structures and built-in or user-defined types that reference fundamental types. The data this function requests depends on its expression parameter, which accepts any of the following arguments: Built-in variables and function calls Variables calculated by the script Tuples Calls to user-defined functions Chart points Collections User-defined types Built-in variables and functions A frequent use case of request.security() is requesting the output of a built-in variable or function/method call from another symbol or timeframe. For example, suppose we want to calculate the 20-bar SMA of a symbol’s ohlc4 price from the daily timeframe while on an intraday chart. We can accomplish this with a single line of code: The above line calculates the value of ta.sma(ohlc4, 20) on the current symbol from the daily timeframe. It’s important to note that newcomers to Pine may sometimes confuse the above line of code as being equivalent to the following: However, this line will return an entirely different result. Rather than requesting a 20-bar SMA from the daily timeframe, it requests the ohlc4 price from the daily timeframe and calclates the ta.sma() of the results over 20 chart bars. In essence, when the intention is to request the results of an expression from other contexts, pass the expression directly to the expression parameter in the request.security() call, as demonstrated in the initial example. Let’s expand on this concept. The script below calculates a multi-timeframe (MTF) ribbon of moving averages, where each moving average in the ribbon calculates over the same number of bars on its respective timeframe. Each request.security() call uses ta.sma(close, length) as its expression argument to return a length -bar SMA from the specified timeframe: Note that: The script calculates the ribbon’s higher timeframes by multiplying the chart’s timeframe.in_seconds() value by 2, 3, and 4, then converting each result into a valid timeframe string using timeframe.from_seconds(). Instead of calling ta.sma() within each request.security() call, one could use the chartAvg variable as the expression in each call to achieve the same result. See the next section for more information. On realtime bars, this script also tracks unconfirmed SMA values from each higher timeframe. See the Historical and realtime behavior section to learn more. Calculated variables The expression parameter of request.security() accepts variables declared in the global scope, allowing scripts to evaluate their variables’ calculations from other contexts without redundantly listing the operations in each function call. For example, one can declare the following variable: and execute the variable’s calculation from another context with request.security(): The function call in the line above will return the result of the priceReturn calculation on another symbol ’s data as a series adapted to the current chart, which the script can display directly on the chart or utilize in additional operations. The following example compares the price returns of the current chart’s symbol and another specified symbol . The script declares the priceReturn variable from the chart’s context, then uses that variable in request.security() to evaluate its calculation on another symbol . It then calculates the correlation between the priceReturn and requestedReturn and plots the result on the chart: Note that: The request.security() call executes the same calculation used in the priceReturn declaration, except it uses the close values fetched from the input symbol . The script colors the plot with a gradient based on the correlation value. To learn more about color gradients in Pine, see this section of our User Manual’s page on colors. Tuples Tuples in Pine Script™ are comma-separated sets of expressions enclosed in brackets that can hold multiple values of any available type. We use tuples when creating functions or other local blocks that return more than one value. The request.security() function can accept a tuple as its expression argument, allowing scripts to request multiple series of different types using a single function call. The expressions within requested tuples can be of any type outlined throughout the Requestable data section of this page, excluding other tuples. Tuples are particularly handy when a script needs to retrieve more than one value from a specific context. For example, this script calculates the percent rank of the close price over length bars and assigns the expression to the rank variable. It then calls request.security() to request a tuple containing the rank , ta.crossover(rank, 50), and ta.crossunder(rank, 50) values from the specified timeframe . The script plots the requestedRank and uses the crossOver and crossUnder “bool” values within bgcolor() to conditionally highlight the chart pane’s background: Note that: We’ve offset the rank variable’s expression by one bar using the history-referencing operator [] and included barmerge.lookahead_on in the request.security() call to ensure the values on realtime bars do not repaint after becoming historical bars. See the Avoiding repainting section for more information. The request.security() call returns a tuple, so we use a tuple declaration to declare the requestedRank , crossOver , and crossUnder variables. To learn more about using tuples, see this section of our User Manual’s Type system page. User-defined functions User-defined functions and methods are custom functions written by users. They allow users to define sequences of operations associated with an identifier that scripts can conveniently call throughout their executions (e.g., myUDF() ). The request.security() function can request the results of user-defined functions and methods whose scopes consist of any types outlined throughout this page’s Requestable data section. For example, this script contains a user-defined weightedBB() function that calculates Bollinger Bands with the basis average weighted by a specified weight series. The function returns a tuple of custom band values. The script calls the weightedBB() as the expression argument in request.security() to retrieve a tuple of band values calculated on the specified timeframe and plots the results on the chart: Note that: We offset the source and weight arguments in the weightedBB() call used as the expression in request.security() and used barmerge.lookahead_on to ensure the requested results reflect the last confirmed values from the timeframe on realtime bars. See this section to learn more. Chart points Chart points are reference types that represent coordinates on the chart. Lines, boxes, polylines, and labels use chart.point objects to set their display locations. The request.security() function can use the ID of a chart.point instance in its expression argument, allowing scripts to retrieve chart coordinates from other contexts. The example below requests a tuple of historical chart points from a higher timeframe and uses them to draw boxes on the chart. The script declares the topLeft and bottomRight variables that reference chart.point IDs from the last confirmed bar. It then uses request.security() to request a tuple containing the IDs of chart points representing the topLeft and bottomRight from a higherTimeframe . When a new bar starts on the higherTimeframe , the script draws a new box using the time and price coordinates from the requestedTopLeft and requestedBottomRight chart points: Note that: Since this example is designed specifically for higher timeframes, we’ve included a custom runtime error that the script raises when the timeframe.in_seconds() of the higherTimeframe is smaller than that of the chart’s timeframe. Collections Pine Script™ collections (arrays, matrices, and maps) are data structures that contain an arbitrary number of elements with specified types. The request.security() function can retrieve the IDs of collections whose elements consist of: Fundamental types Chart points User-defined types that satisfy the criteria listed in the section below This example calculates the ratio of a confirmed bar’s high-low range to the range between the highest and lowest values over 10 bars from a specified symbol and timeframe . It uses maps to hold the values used in the calculations. The script creates a data map with “string” keys and “float” values to hold high, low, highest, and lowest price values on each bar, which it uses as the expression in request.security() to calculate an otherData map representing the data from the specified context. It uses the values associated with the “High”, “Low”, “Highest”, and “Lowest” keys of the otherData map to calculate the ratio that it plots in the chart pane: Note that: The request.security() call in this script can return na if no data is available from the specified context. Since one cannot call methods on a map variable when its value is na, we’ve added an if structure to only calculate a new ratio value when otherData references a valid map ID. User-defined types User-defined types (UDTs) are composite types containing an arbitrary number of fields, which can be of any available type, including other user-defined types. The request.security() function can retrieve the IDs of objects produced by UDTs from other contexts if their fields consist of: Fundamental types Chart points Collections that satisfy the criteria listed in the section above Other UDTs whose fields consist of any of these types The following example requests an object ID using a specified symbol and displays its field values on a chart pane. The script contains a TickerInfo UDT with “string” fields for syminfo.* values, an array field to store recent “float” price data, and an “int” field to hold the requested ticker’s bar_index value. It assigns a new TickerInfo ID to an info variable on every bar and uses the variable as the expression in request.security() to retrieve the ID of an object representing the calculated info from the specified symbol . The script displays the requestedInfo object’s description , tickerType , currency , and barIndex values in a label and uses plotcandle() to display the values from its prices array: Note that: The syminfo.* variables used in this script all return “simple string” qualified types. However, objects in Pine are always qualified as “series”. Consequently, all values assigned to the info object’s fields automatically adopt the “series” qualifier. It is possible for the request.security() call to return na due to differences between the data requested from the symbol and the main chart. This script assigns a new TickerInfo object to the requestedInfo in that case to prevent runtime errors. `request.security_lower_tf()` The request.security_lower_tf() function is an alternative to request.security() designed for reliably requesting information from lower-timeframe (LTF) contexts. While request.security() can retrieve data from a single intrabar (LTF bar) in each chart bar, request.security_lower_tf() retrieves data from all available intrabars in each chart bar, which the script can access and use in additional calculations. Each request.security_lower_tf() call can retrieve up to 100,000 intrabars from a lower timeframe. See this section of our Limitations page for more information. Below is the function’s signature, which is similar to request.security(): This function only requests data from timeframes less than or equal to the chart’s timeframe. If the timeframe of the request represents a higher timeframe than the chart’s timeframe, the function will either raise a runtime error or return na values depending on the ignore_invalid_timeframe argument in the call. The default value for this parameter is false , meaning it raises an error and halt the script’s executions when attempting to request HTF data. Requesting intrabar data Intrabar data can provide a script with additional information that may not be obvious or accessible from solely analyzing data sampled on the chart’s timerframe. The request.security_lower_tf() function can retrieve many data types from an intrabar context. Before you venture further in this section, we recommend exploring the Requestable data portion of the request.security() section above, which provides foundational information about the types of data one can request. The expression parameter in request.security_lower_tf() accepts most of the same arguments discussed in that section, excluding direct references to collections and mutable variables declared in the script’s main scope. Although it accepts many of the same types of arguments, this function returns array results, which comes with some differences in interpretation and handling, as explained below. Intrabar data arrays Lower timeframes contain more data points than higher timeframes, as new values come in at a higher frequency. For example, when comparing a 1-minute chart to an hourly chart, the 1- minute chart will have up to 60 times the number of bars per hour, depending on the available data. To address the fact that multiple intrabars exist within a chart bar, request.security_lower_tf() always returns its results as arrays. The elements in the returned arrays represent the expression values retrieved from the lower timeframe sorted in ascending order based on each intrabar’s timestamp. The type template assigned to the returned arrays corresponds to the value types passed in the request.security_lower_tf() call. For example, using an “int” as the expression will produce an array<int> instance, a “bool” as the expression will produce an array<bool> instance, etc. The following script uses intrabar information to decompose the chart’s close-to-close price changes into positive and negative parts. It calls request.security_lower_tf() to fetch a “float” array of ta.change(close) values from the lowerTimeframe on each chart bar, then accesses all the array’s elements using a for…in loop to accumulate positiveChange and negativeChange sums. The script adds the accumulated values to calculate the netChange , then plots the results on the chart alongside the priceChange for comparison: Note that: The plots based on intrabar data may not appear on all available chart bars, as request.security_lower_tf() can only access up to the most recent 100,000 intrabars available from the requested context. When executing this function on a chart bar that doesn’t have accessible intrabar data, it will return an empty array. The number of intrabars per chart bar may vary depending on the data available from the context and the chart the script executes on. For example, a provider’s 1-minute data feed may not include data for every minute within the 60-minute timeframe due to a lack of trading activity over some 1-minute intervals. To check the number of intrabars retrieved for a chart bar, one can use array.size() on the resulting array. If the lowerTimeframe value is greater than the chart’s timeframe, the script will raise a runtime error, as we have not supplied an ignore_invalid_timeframe argument in the request.security_lower_tf() call. Tuples of intrabar data When passing a tuple or a function call that returns a tuple as the expression argument in request.security_lower_tf(), the result is a tuple of arrays with type templates corresponding to the types within the argument. For example, using a [float, string, color] tuple as the expression will result in [array<float>, array<string>, array<color>] data returned by the function. Using a tuple expression allows a script to fetch several arrays of intrabar data with a single request.security_lower_tf() function call. The following example requests OHLC data from a lower timeframe and visualizes the current bar’s intrabars on the chart using lines and boxes. The script calls request.security_lower_tf() with the [open, high, low, close] tuple as its expression to retrieve a tuple of arrays representing OHLC information from a calculated lowerTimeframe . It then uses a for loop to set line coordinates with the retrieved data and current bar indices to display the results next to the current chart bar, providing a “magnified view” of the price movement within the latest candle. It also draws a box around the lines to indicate the chart region occupied by intrabar drawings: Note that: The script draws each candle using two lines: one to represent wicks and the other to represent the body. Since the script can display up to 500 lines on the chart, we’ve limited the maxIntrabars input to 250. The lowerTimeframe value is the result of calculating the math.ceil() of the timeframe.in_seconds() divided by the maxIntrabars and converting to a valid timeframe string with timeframe.from_seconds(). The script sets the top of the box drawing using the array.max() of the requested hData array, and it sets the box’s bottom using the array.min() of the requested lData array. As we see on the chart, these values correspond to the high and low of the chart bar. Requesting collections In some cases, a script may need to request the IDs of collections from an intrabar context. However, unlike request.security(), one cannot pass collections or calls to functions that return them as the expression argument in a request.security_lower_tf() call, as arrays cannot directly reference other collections. Despite these limitations, it is possible to request collections from lower timeframes, if needed, with the help of wrapper types. To make collections requestable with request.security_lower_tf(), we must create a UDT with a field to reference a collection ID. This step is necessary since arrays cannot reference other collections directly but can reference UDTs with collection fields: With our Wrapper UDT defined, we can now pass the IDs of objects of the UDT to the expression parameter in request.security_lower_tf(). A straightforward approach is to call the built-in *.new() function as the expression . For example, this line of code calls Wrapper.new() with array.from(close) as its collection within request.security_lower_tf(): Alternatively, we can create a user-defined function or method that returns an object of the UDT and call that function within request.security_lower_tf(). For instance, this code calls a custom newWrapper() function that returns a Wrapper ID as the expression argument: The result with either of the above is an array containing Wrapper IDs from all available intrabars in the chart bar, which the script can use to reference Wrapper instances from specific intrabars and use their collection fields in additional operations. The script below utilizes this approach to collect arrays of intrabar data from a lowerTimeframe and uses them to display data from a specific intrabar. Its custom Prices type contains a single data field to reference array<float> instances that hold price data, and the user-defined newPrices() function returns the ID of a Prices object. The script calls request.security_lower_tf() with a newPrices() call as its expression argument to retrieve an array of Prices IDs from each intrabar in the chart bar, then uses array.get() to get the ID from a specified available intrabar, if it exists. Lastly, it uses array.get() on the data array assigned to that instance and calls plotcandle() to display its values on the chart: Note that: The intrabarPrices variable only references a Prices ID if the size of the requestedPrices array is greater than the intrabarIndex , as attempting to use array.get() to get an element that doesn’t exist will result in an out of bounds error. The intrabarData variable only references the data field from intrabarPrices if a valid Prices ID exists since a script cannot reference fields of an na value. The process used in this example is not necessary to achieve the intended result. We could instead avoid using UDTs and pass an [open, high, low, close] tuple to the expression parameter to retrieve a tuple of arrays for further operations, as explained in the previous section. Custom contexts Pine Script™ includes multiple ticker.*() functions that allow scripts to construct custom ticker IDs that specify additional settings for data requests when used as a symbol argument in request.security() and request.security_lower_tf(): ticker.new() constructs a custom ticker ID from a specified prefix and ticker with additional session and adjustment settings. ticker.modify() constructs a modified form of a specified tickerid with additional session and adjustment settings. ticker.heikinashi(), ticker.renko(), ticker.pointfigure(), ticker.kagi(), and ticker.linebreak() construct a modified form a symbol with non-standard chart settings. ticker.inherit() constructs a new ticker ID for a symbol with additional parameters inherited from the from_tickerid specified in the function call, allowing scripts to request the symbol data with the same modifiers as the from_tickerid , including session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart type, back- adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc. ticker.standard() constructs a standard ticker ID representing the symbol without additional modifiers. Let’s explore some practical examples of applying ticker.*() functions to request data from custom contexts. Suppose we want to include dividend adjustment in a stock symbol’s prices without enabling the “Adjust data for dividends” option in the “Symbol” section of the chart’s settings. We can achieve this in a script by constructing a custom ticker ID for the instrument using ticker.new() or ticker.modify() with an adjustment value of adjustment.dividends. This script creates an adjustedTickerID using ticker.modify(), uses that ticker ID as the symbol in request.security() to retrieve a tuple of adjusted price values, then plots the result as candles on the chart. It also highlights the background when the requested prices differ from the prices without dividend adjustment. As we see on the “NYSE:XOM” chart below, enabling dividend adjustment results in different historical values before the date of the latest dividend: Note that: If a modifier included in a constructed ticker ID does not apply to the symbol, the script will ignore that modifier when requesting data. For instance, this script will display the same values as the main chart on forex symbols such as “EURUSD”. While the example above demonstrates a simple way to modify the chart’s symbol, a more frequent use case for ticker.*() functions is applying custom modifiers to another symbol while requesting data. If a ticker ID referenced in a script already has the modifiers one would like to apply (e.g., adjustment settings, session type, etc.), they can use ticker.inherit() to quickly and efficiently add those modifiers to another symbol. In the example below, we’ve edited the previous script to request data for a symbolInput using modifiers inherited from the adjustedTickerID . This script calls ticker.inherit() to construct an inheritedTickerID and uses that ticker ID in a request.security() call. It also requests data for the symbolInput without additional modifiers and plots candles for both ticker IDs in a separate chart pane to compare the difference. As shown on the chart, the data requested using the inheritedTickerID includes dividend adjustment, whereas the data requested using the symbolInput directly does not: Note that: Since the adjustedTickerID represents a modified form of the syminfo.tickerid, if we modify the chart’s context in other ways, such as changing the chart type or enabling extended trading hours in the chart’s settings, those modifiers will also apply to the adjustedTickerID and inheritedTickerID . However, they will not apply to the symbolInput since it represents a standard ticker ID. Another frequent use case for requesting custom contexts is retrieving data that uses non- standard chart calculations. For example, suppose we want to use Renko price values to calculate trade signals in a strategy() script. If we simply change the chart type to “Renko” to get the prices, the strategy will also simulate its trades based on those synthetic prices, producing misleading results: To ensure our strategy shows results based on actual prices, we can create a Renko ticker ID using ticker.renko() while keeping the chart on a standard type, allowing the script to request and use Renko prices to calculate its signals without calculating the strategy results on them: Historical and realtime behavior Functions in the request.*() namespace can behave differently on historical and realtime bars. This behavior is closely related to Pine’s Execution model. Consider how a script behaves within the main context. Throughout the chart’s history, the script calculates its required values once and commits them to that bar so their states are accessible on subsequent executions. On an unconfirmed bar, however, the script recalculates its values on each update to the bar’s data to align with realtime changes. Before recalculating the values on that bar, it reverts calculated values to their last committed states, otherwise known as rollback, and it only commits values to that bar once the bar closes. Now consider the behavior of data requests from other contexts with request.security(). As when evaluating historical bars in the main context, request.security() only returns new historical values when it confirms a bar in its specified context. When executing on realtime bars, it returns recalculated values on each chart bar, similar to how a script recalculates values in the main context on the open chart bar. However, the function only confirms the requested values when a bar from its context closes. When the script restarts, what were previously realtime bars become historical bars. Therefore, request.security() only returns the values it confirmed on those bars. In essence, this behavior means that requested data may repaint when its values fluctuate on realtime bars without confirmation from the context. In most circumstances where a script requests data from a broader context, one will typically require confirmed, stable values that do not fluctuate on realtime bars. The section below explains how to achieve such a result and avoid repainting data requests. Avoiding Repainting Higher-timeframe data When requesting values from a higher timeframe, they are subject to repainting since realtime bars can contain unconfirmed information from developing HTF bars, and the script may adjust the times that new values come in on historical bars. To avoid repainting HTF data, one must ensure that the function only returns confirmed values with consistent timing on all bars, regardless of bar state. The most reliable approach to achieve non-repainting results is to use an expression argument that only references past bars (e.g., close[1] ) while using barmerge.lookahead_on as the lookahead value. Using barmerge.lookahead_on with non-offset HTF data requests is discouraged since it prompts request.security() to “look ahead” to the final values of an HTF bar, retrieving confirmed values before they’re actually available in the script’s history. However, if the values used in the expression are offset by at least one bar, the “future” data the function retrieves is no longer from the future. Instead, the data represents confirmed values from established, available HTF bars. In other words, applying an offset to the expression effectively prevents the requested data from repainting when the script restarts its executions and eliminates lookahead bias in the historical series. The following example demonstrates a repainting HTF data request. The script uses request.security() without offset modifications or additional arguments to retrieve the results of a ta.wma() call from a higher timeframe. It also highlights the background to indicate which bars were in a realtime state during its calculations. As shown on the chart below, the plot of the requested WMA only changes on historical bars when HTF bars close, whereas it fluctuates on all realtime bars since the data includes unconfirmed values from the higher timeframe: To avoid repainting in this script, we can add lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on to the request.security() call and offset the call history of ta.wma() by one bar with the history- referencing operator [], ensuring the request always retrieves the last confirmed HTF bar’s WMA at the start of each new timeframe . Unlike the previous script, this version has consistent behavior on historical and realtime bar states, as we see below: Lower-timeframe data The request.security() and request.security_lower_tf() functions can retrieve data from lower- timeframe contexts. The request.security() function can only retrieve data from a single intrabar in each chart bar, and request.security_lower_tf() retrieves data from all available intrabars. When using these functions to retrieve intrabar data, it’s important to note that such requests are not immune to repainting behavior. Historical and realtime series often rely on separate data feeds. Data providers may retroactively modify realtime data, and it’s possible for races to occur in realtime data feeds, as explained in the Data feeds section of this page. Either case may result in intrabar data retrieved on realtime bars repainting after the script restarts its executions. Additionally, a particular case that will cause repainting LTF requests is using request.security() with barmerge.lookahead_on to retrieve data from the first intrabar in each chart bar. While it will generally work as expected on historical bars, it will track only the most recent intrabar on realtime bars, as request.security() does not retain all intrabar information, and the intrabars the function retrieves on realtime bars are unsorted until restarting the script: One can mitigate this behavior and track the values from the first intrabar, or any available intrabar in the chart bar, by using request.security_lower_tf() since it maintains an array of intrabar values ordered by the times they come in. Here, we call array.first() on a requested array of intrabar data to retrieve the close price from the first available intrabar in each chart bar: Note that: While request.security_lower_tf() is more optimized for handling historical and realtime intrabars, it’s still possible in some cases for minor repainting to occur due to data differences from the provider, as outlined above. This code may not show intrabar data on all available chart bars, depending on how many intrabars each chart bar contains, as request.*() functions can retrieve up to 100,000 intrabars from an LTF context. See this section of the Limitations page for more information. `request.currency_rate()` When a script needs to convert values expressed in one currency to another, one can use request.currency_rate(). This function requests a daily rate for currency conversion calculations based on currency pair or spread data from the most popular exchanges, providing a simpler alternative to fetching specific pairs or spreads with request.security(). While one can use request.security() to retrieve daily currency rates, its use case is more involved than request.currency_rate(), as one needs to supply a valid ticker ID for a currency pair or spread to request the rate. Additionally, a historical offset and barmerge.lookahead_on are necessary to prevent the results from repainting, as explained in this section. The request.currency_rate() function, on the other hand, only requires currency codes. No ticker ID is needed when requesting rates with this function, and it ensures non-repainting results without requiring additional specification. The function’s signature is as follows: The from parameter specifies the currency to convert, and the to parameter specifies the target currency. Both parameters accept “string” values representing valid currency codes (e.g., “USD”) or any built-in currency.* variable (e.g., currency.USD). When the function cannot calculate a valid conversion rate between the specified from and to currencies, programmers can decide whether it raises a runtime error or returns na via the ignore_invalid_currency parameter. The default value is false , meaning the function raises a runtime error and halts the script’s executions. The following example demonstrates a simple use case for request.currency_rate(). Suppose we want to convert values expressed in Turkish lira (currency.TRY) to South Korean won (currency.KRW) using a daily conversion rate. If we use request.security() to retrieve the rate, we must supply a valid ticker ID and request the last confirmed close from the previous day. In this case, no valid symbol exists that would allow us to retrieve a conversion rate directly with request.security(). Therefore, we first need a ticker ID for a spread that converts TRY to an intermediate currency, such as USD, then converts the intermediate currency to KRW. We can then use that ticker ID within request.security() with close[1] as the expression and barmerge.lookahead_on as the lookahead value to request a non-repainting daily rate. Alternatively, we can achieve the same result more simply by calling request.currency_rate(). This function does all the heavy lifting for us, only requiring from and to currency arguments to perform its calculation. As we see below, both approaches return the same daily rate: `request.dividends()`, `request.splits()`, and `request.earnings()` Analyzing a stock’s earnings data and corporate actions provides helpful insights into its underlying financial strength. Pine Script™ provides the ability to retrieve essential information about applicable stocks via request.dividends(), request.splits(), and request.earnings(). These are the functions’ signatures: Each function has the same parameters in its signature, with the exception of request.splits(), which doesn’t have a currency parameter. Note that unlike the symbol parameter in other request.*() functions, the ticker parameter in these functions only accepts an “Exchange:Symbol” pair, such as “NASDAQ:AAPL”. The built-in syminfo.ticker variable does not work with these functions since it does not contain exchange information. Instead, one must use syminfo.tickerid for such cases. The field parameter determines the data the function will retrieve. Each of these functions accepts different built-in variables as the field argument since each requests different information about a stock: The request.dividends() function retrieves current dividend information for a stock, i.e., the amount per share the issuing company paid out to investors who purchased shares before the ex-dividend date. Passing the built-in dividends.gross or dividends.net variables to the field parameter specifies whether the returned value represents dividends before or after factoring in expenses the company deducts from its payouts. The request.splits() function retrieves current split and reverse split information for a stock. A split occurs when a company increases its outstanding shares to promote liquidity. A reverse split occurs when a company consolidates its shares and offers them at a higher price to attract specific investors or maintain their listing on a market that has a minimum per-share price. Companies express their split information as ratios. For example, a 5:1 split means the company issued additional shares to its shareholders so that they have five times the number of shares they had before the split, and the raw price of each share becomes one-fifth of the previous price. Passing splits.numerator or splits.denominator to the field parameter of request.splits() determines whether it returns the numerator or denominator of the split ratio. The request.earnings() function retrieves the earnings per share (EPS) information for a stock ticker ’s issuing company. The EPS value is the ratio of a company’s net income to the number of outstanding stock shares, which investors consider an indicator of the company’s profitability. Passing earnings.actual, earnings.estimate, or earnings.standardized as the field argument in request.earnings() respectively determines whether the function requests the actual, estimated, or standardized EPS value. For a detailed explanation of the gaps , lookahead , and ignore_invalid_symbol parameters of these functions, see the Common characteristics section at the top of this page. It’s important to note that the values returned by these functions reflect the data available as it comes in. This behavior differs from financial data originating from a request.financial() call in that the underlying data from such calls becomes available according to a company’s fiscal reporting period. Here, we’ve included an example that displays a handy table containing the most recent dividend, split, and EPS data. The script calls the request.*() functions discussed in this section to retrieve the data, then converts the values to “strings” with str.*() functions and displays the results in the infoTable with table.cell(): Note that: We’ve included barmerge.gaps_on in the request.*() calls, so they only return values when new data is available. Otherwise, they return na. The script assigns a table ID to the infoTable variable on the first chart bar. On subsequent bars, it updates necessary cells with new information whenever data is available. If no information is available from any of the request.*() calls throughout the chart’s history (e.g., if the ticker has no dividend information), the script does not initialize the corresponding cells since it’s unnecessary. `request.quandl()` TradingView forms partnerships with many fintech companies to provide users access to extensive information on financial instruments, economic data, and more. One of our many partners is Nasdaq Data Link (formerly Quandl), which provides multiple external data feeds that scripts can access via the request.quandl() function. Here is the function’s signature: The ticker parameter accepts a “string” value representing the ID of the database published on Nasdaq Data Link and its time series code, separated by the ”/” delimiter. For example, the code “FRED/DFF” represents the “Effective Federal Funds Rate” time series from the “Federal Reserve Economic Data” database. The index parameter accepts an “int” value representing the column index of the requested data, where 0 is the first available column. Consult the database’s documentaion on Nasdaq Data Link’s website to see available columns. For details on the gaps and ignore_invalid_symbol parameters, see the Common characteristics section of this page.

`request.seed()`
TradingView aggregates a vast amount of data from its many providers, including price and
volume information on tradable instruments, financials, economic data, and more, which users
can retrieve in Pine Script™ using the functions discussed in the sections above, as well as
multiple built-in variables.
To further expand the horizons of possible data one can analyze on TradingView, we have
Pine Seeds, which allows users to supply custom user-maintained EOD data feeds via GitHub
for use on TradingView charts and within Pine Script™ code.
To retrieve data from a Pine Seeds data feed within a script, use the request.seed() function.
Below is the function’s signature:
The source parameter specifies the unique name of the user-maintained GitHub repository
that contains the data feed.
The symbol parameter represents the file name from the “data/” directory of the source
repository, excluding the “.csv” file extension. See this page for information about the
structure of the data stored in repositories.
The expression parameter is the series to evaluate using data extracted from the requested
context. It is similar to the equivalent in request.security() and request.security_lower_tf().
Data feeds stored in user-maintained repos contain time, open, high, low, close, and volume
information, meaning the expression argument can use the corresponding built-in variables,
including variables derived from them (e.g., bar_index, ohlc4, etc.) to request their values
from the context of the custom data.
The script below visualizes sample data from the seed_crypto_santiment demo repository. It
uses two calls to request.seed() to retrieve the close values from the repository’s
BTC_SENTIMENT_POSITIVE_TOTAL and BTC_SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE_TOTAL data feeds and
plots the results on the chart as step lines:
Note that:
This example requests data from the repository highlighted in the Pine Seeds
documentation. It exists solely for example purposes, and its data does not update on a
regular basis.
Unlike most other request.*() functions, request.seed() does not have a gaps
parameter. It always returns na values when no new data exists.
Pine Seeds data is searchable from the chart’s symbol search bar. To load a data feed
on the chart, enter the “Repo:File” pair, similar to searching for an “Exchange:Symbol”
pair.

Notice! Throughout this page, and in other parts of our documentation that discuss request.*() functions, we often use the term “context” to describe the symbol, timeframe, and any modifications (price adjustments, session settings, non-standard chart types, etc.) that apply to a chart or the data retrieved by a script. request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, calc_bars_count) → series <type> request.security_lower_tf(symbol, timeframe, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, ignore_invalid_timeframe, calc_bars_count) → array<type> request.currency_rate(from, to, ignore_invalid_currency) → series float request.dividends(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float request.splits(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float request.earnings(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float request.quandl(ticker, gaps, index, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float request.financial(symbol, financial_id, period, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float request.economic(country_code, field, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float request.seed(source, symbol, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, calc_bars_count) → series <type> Notice! Users can also allow compatible scripts to evaluate their scopes in other contexts without requiring request.*() functions by using the timeframe parameter of the indicator() declaration statement. Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("Behavior of `request.security()` demo") //@variable The 20-bar linear regression slope of `hl2` prices from the "AMEX:SPY" s float requestedSlope = request.security("AMEX:SPY", "1D", ta.linreg(hl2, 20, 0) - ta //@variable Is `color.teal` when the `requestedSlope` is positive, and `color.maroon color plotColor = requestedSlope > 0 ? color.teal : color.maroon // Plot the `requestedSlope` with the `plotColor`. plot(requestedSlope, "Requested slope", plotColor, 1, plot.style_area) Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("Behavior of `request.financial()` demo", format = format.volume) //@variable The annual cost of goods sold by the chart symbol's issuing company. float costOfGoods = request.financial(syminfo.tickerid, "COST_OF_GOODS", "FY") // Plot the `costOfGoods`. plot(costOfGoods, "Cost of goods", color.purple, 3, plot.style_stepline_diamond) Notice! When using the timeframe parameter of the indicator() function to evaluate the entire script in a different timeframe, the timeframe_gaps parameter specifies how the script handles nonexistent values. This parameter is similar to the gaps parameter for request.*() functions. Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("`gaps` demo", overlay = true) //@variable The `close` requested from the hourly timeframe without gaps. float dataWithoutGaps = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "60", close, gaps = barme //@variable The `close` requested from the hourly timeframe with gaps. float dataWithGaps = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "60", close, gaps = barmerge // Plot the requested data. plot(dataWithoutGaps, "Data without gaps", color.blue, 3, plot.style_linebr) plot(dataWithGaps, "Data with gaps", color.purple, 15, plot.style_linebr) // Highlight the background for realtime bars. bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.aqua, 70) : na, title = "Realtime bar Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("`ignore_invalid_symbol` demo", "Market cap estimate", format = format.vol //@variable The symbol to request data from. string symbol = input.symbol("TSX:SHOP", "Symbol") //@function Estimates the market capitalization of the specified `tickerID` if the d calcMarketCap(simple string tickerID) => //@variable The quarterly total shares outstanding for the `tickerID`.

Not all request.*() function calls return values expressed as a currency amount. Therefore, currency conversion is not always necessary. For example, some series the request.financial() function returns use units other than currency, such as the “PIOTROSKI_F_SCORE” and “NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES” metrics. It is up to programmers to determine when currency conversion is appropriate in their data requests. Notice! Using request.security() to leak future data into the past is misleading and not allowed in script publications. While your script’s results on historical bars may look great due to its seemingly “magical” acquisition of prescience (which it will not be able to reproduce on realtime bars), you will mislead yourself and the users of your script. If you publish your script to share it with others, ensure you do not mislead users by accessing future information from a dataset on historical bars. Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("`lookahead` demo", overlay = true) //@variable The timeframe to request the data from. string timeframe = input.timeframe("30", "Timeframe") //@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` wi // On realtime bars, it returns the current `high` of the `timeframe`. float lookaheadOff = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high, lookahead = //@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` wi // Returns values that should NOT be accessible yet on historical bars. float lookaheadOn = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high, lookahead = //@variable The requested `high` price from the current symbol on the `timeframe` wi // Behaves the same on historical and realtime bars. float lookaheadOnOffset = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, timeframe, high[1], loo // Plot the values. plot(lookaheadOff, "High, no lookahead bias", color.new(color.blue, 40), 5) plot(lookaheadOn, "High with lookahead bias", color.fuchsia, 3) plot(lookaheadOnOffset, "High, no lookahead bias or repaint", color.aqua, 3) // Highlight the background on realtime bars. bgcolor(barstate.isrealtime ? color.new(color.orange, 60) : na, title = "Realtime ba Notice! In Pine Script™ v1 and v2, the security() function did not include a lookahead parameter, but it behaved as it does in later versions of Pine with lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on , meaning that it systematically used data from the future HTF context on historical bars. Therefore, users should exercise caution with Pine v1 or v2 scripts that use HTF security() calls unless the function calls contain historical offsets.

As a rule, TradingView does not generate data; it relies on its data providers for the information displayed on charts and accessed by scripts. request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, calc_bars_count) → series <type> Notice! When using the value from an input.source() call in the expression argument and the input references a series from another indicator, request.*() functions calculate that value’s results using the chart’s symbol, regardless of the symbol argument supplied, since they cannot evaluate the scopes required by an external series. We therefore do not recommend attempting to request external source input data from other contexts. Pine Script™ //@version=6 indicator("Higher timeframe security demo", overlay = true) //@variable The higher timeframe to request data from. string higherTimeframe = input.timeframe("240", "Higher timeframe") //@variable The `hl2` value from the `higherTimeframe`.

While scripts can use request.security() to retrieve the values from a single intrabar on each chart bar, which might provide utility in some unique cases, we recommend using the request.security_lower_tf() function for intrabar analysis when possible, as it returns an array containing data from all available intrabars within a chart bar. See this section to learn more. Notice! The request.security() function duplicates the scopes and operations required by the expression to calculate its requested values in another context, which elevates runtime memory consumption. Additionally, the extra scopes produced by each call to request.security() count toward the script’s compilation limits. See the Scope count section of the Limitations page for more information.

As with request.security(), request.security_lower_tf() duplicates the scopes and operations required to calculate the expression from another context.

The request.quandl() function can only request free data from Nasdaq Data Link. No data that requires a paid subscription to their services is accessible with this function. Nasdaq Data Link may change the data it provides over time, and they may not update available datasets regularly. Therefore, it’s up to programmers to research the supported data available for request and review the documentation provided for each dataset. You can search for free data here.
Notice! The creation of new Pine Seeds repositories is currently unavailable.
However, the data feeds from existing repositories are still accessible from charts and
Pine scripts. The documentation here provides in-depth information about Pine Seeds
functionality and instructions for requesting the return of full Pine Seeds support.

duplicates the scopes necessary to evaluate its expression in another context, which
contributes toward compilation limits and script memory demands. See the Limitations

Introduction
The plot() function is the most frequently used function used to display information calculated
using Pine scripts. It is versatile and can plot different styles of lines, histograms, areas,
columns (like volume columns), fills, circles or crosses.
The use of plot() to create fills is explained in the page on Fills.
This script showcases a few different uses of plot() in an overlay script:
Note that:
The first plot() call plots a 1-pixel blue line across the bar highs.
The second plots crosses at the mid-point of bodies. The crosses are colored lime when
the bar is up and purple when it is down. The argument used for linewidth is 6 but it
is not a pixel value; just a relative size.
The third call plots a 3-pixel wide step line following the low point of bodies.
The fourth call plot a gray circle at the bars’ low.
The last plot requires some preparation. We first define our bull/bear colors, calculate an
Arnaud Legoux Moving Average, then make our color calculations. We initialize our color
variable on bar zero only, using var. We initialize it to color.silver, so on the dataset’s first
bars, until one of our conditions causes the color to change, the line will be silver. The
conditions that change the color of the line require it to be higher/lower than its value
two bars ago. This makes for less noisy color transitions than if we merely looked for a
higher/lower value than the previous one.
This script shows other uses of plot() in a pane:
Note that:
We are plotting normal volume values as wide columns above the zero line (see the
style = plot.style_columns in our plot() call).
Before plotting the columns we calculate our volumeColor by using the values of the
barUp and barDn boolean variables. They become respectively true when the
current bar’s close is higher/lower than the previous one. Note that the “Volume” built-in
does not use the same condition; it identifies an up bar with close > open . We use the
GREEN_LIGHTER and PINK_LIGHTER colors for the volume columns.
Because the first plot plots columns, we do not use the linewidth parameter, as it has
no effect on columns.
Our script’s second plot is the change in volume, which we have calculated earlier using
ta.change(volume) . This value is plotted as a histogram, for which the linewidth
parameter controls the width of the column. We make this width 12 so that histogram
elements are thinner than the columns of the first plot. Positive/negative volumeChange
values plot above/below the zero line; no manipulation is required to achieve this effect.
Before plotting the histogram of volumeChange values, we calculate its color value,
which can be one of four different colors. We use the bright GREEN or PINK colors
when the bar is up/down AND the volume has increased since the last bar
( volumeChange > 0 ). Because volumeChange is positive in this case, the histogram’s
element will be plotted above the zero line. We use the bright GREEN_LIGHT or
PINK_LIGHT colors when the bar is up/down AND the volume has NOT increased since
the last bar. Because volumeChange is negative in this case, the histogram’s element will
be plotted below the zero line.
Finally, we plot a zero line. We could just as well have used hline(0) there.
We use format = format.volume in our indicator() call so that large values displayed for
this script are abbreviated like those of the built-in “Volume” indicator.
plot() calls must always be placed in a line’s first position, which entails they are always in the
script’s global scope. They can’t be placed in user-defined functions or structures like if, for,
etc. Calls to plot() can, however, be designed to plot conditionally in two ways, which we
cover in the Conditional plots section of this page.
A script can only plot in its own visual space, whether it is in a pane or on the chart as an
overlay. Scripts running in a pane can only color bars in the chart area.
`plot()` parameters
The plot() function has the following signature:
The parameters of plot() are:
series
It is the only mandatory parameter. Its argument must be of “series int/float” type. Note
that because the auto-casting rules in Pine Script™ convert in the int 🠆 float 🠆 bool
direction, a “bool” type variable cannot be used as is; it must be converted to an “int” or a
“float” for use as an argument. For example, if newDay is of “bool” type, then newDay ? 1
: 0 can be used to plot 1 when the variable is true , and zero when it is false .
title
Requires a “const string” argument, so it must be known at compile time. The string
appears:
In the script’s scale when the “Chart settings/Scales/Indicator Name Label” field is
checked.
In the Data Window.
In the “Settings/Style” tab.
In the dropdown of input.source() fields.
In the “Condition” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box, when the script is selected.
As the column header when exporting chart data to a CSV file.
color
Accepts “series color”, so can be calculated on the fly, bar by bar. Plotting with na as the
color, or any color with a transparency of 100, is one way to hide plots when they are not
needed.
linewidth
Is the plotted element’s size, but it does not apply to all styles. When a line is plotted, the
unit is pixels. It has no impact when plot.style_columns is used.
style
The available arguments are:
plot.style_line (the default): It plots a continous line using the linewidth argument in
pixels for its width. na values will not plot as a line, but they will be bridged when a value
that is not na comes in. Non-na values are only bridged if they are visible on the chart.
plot.style_linebr: Allows the plotting of discontinuous lines by not plotting on na values,
and not joining gaps, i.e., bridging over na values.
plot.style_stepline: Plots using a staircase effect. Transitions between changes in values
are done using a vertical line drawn in middle of bars, as opposed to a point-to-point
diagonal joining the midpoints of bars. Can also be used to achieve an effect similar to
that of plot.style_linebr, but only if care is taken to plot no color on na values.
plot.style_area: plots a line of linewidth width, filling the area between the line and the
histbase . The color argument is used for both the line and the fill. You can make the
line a different color by using another plot() call. Positive values are plotted above the
histbase , negative values below it.
plot.style_areabr: This is similar to plot.style_area but it doesn’t bridge over na values.
Another difference is how the indicator’s scale is calculated. Only the plotted values
serve in the calculation of the y range of the script’s visual space. If only high values
situated far away from the histbase are plotted, for example, those values will be used
to calculate the y scale of the script’s visual space. Positive values are plotted above the
histbase , negative values below it.
plot.style_columns: Plots columns similar to those of the “Volume” built-in indicator. The
linewidth value does not affect the width of the columns. Positive values are plotted
above the histbase , negative values below it. Always includes the value of histbase in
the y scale of the script’s visual space.
plot.style_histogram: Plots columns similar to those of the “Volume” built-in indicator,
except that the linewidth value is used to determine the width of the histogram’s bars
in pixels. Note that since linewidth requires an “input int” value, the width of the
histogram’s bars cannot vary bar to bar. Positive values are plotted above the histbase ,
negative values below it. Always includes the value of histbase in the y scale of the
script’s visual space.
plot.style_circles and plot.style_cross: These plot a shape that is not joined across bars
unless join = true is also used. For these styles, the linewidth argument becomes a
relative sizing measure — its units are not pixels.
trackprice
The default value of this is false . When it is true , a dotted line made up of small
squares will be plotted the full width of the script’s visual space. It is often used in
conjuction with show_last = 1, offset = -99999 to hide the actual plot and only leave the
residual dotted line.
histbase
It is the reference point used with plot.style_area, plot.style_columns and
plot.style_histogram. It determines the level separating positive and negative values of the
series argument. It cannot be calculated dynamically, as an “input int/float” is required.
offset
This allows shifting the plot in the past/future using a negative/positive offset in bars. The
value cannot change during the script’s execution.
join
This only affect styles plot.style_circles or plot.style_cross. When true , the shapes are
joined by a one-pixel line.
editable
This boolean parameter controls whether or not the plot’s properties can be edited in the
“Settings/Style” tab. Its default value is true .
show_last
Allows control over how many of the last bars the plotted values are visible. An “input int”
argument is required, so it cannot be calculated dynamically.
display
The default is display.all. When it is set to display.none, plotted values will not affect the
scale of the script’s visual space. The plot will be invisible and will not appear in indicator
values or the Data Window. It can be useful in plots destined for use as external inputs for
other scripts, or for plots used with the {{plot("[plot_title]")}} placeholder in
alertcondition() calls, e.g.:
force_overlay
If true , the plotted results will display on the main chart pane, even when the script
occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false .
Plotting conditionally
plot() calls cannot be used in conditional structures such as if, but they can be controlled by
varying their plotted values, or their color. When no plot is required, you can either plot na
values, or plot values using na color or any color with 100 transparency (which also makes it
invisible).
Value control
One way to control the display of plots is to plot na values when no plot is needed.
Sometimes, values returned by functions such as request.security() will return na values,
when gaps = barmerge.gaps_on is used, for example. In both these cases it is sometimes
useful to plot discontinuous lines. This script shows a few ways to do it:
Note that:
We define the condition determining when we plot using bar_index % 3 == 0 , which
becomes true when the remainder of the division of the bar index by 3 is zero. This will
happen every three bars.
In the first plot, we use plot.style_linebr, which plots the fuchsia line on highs. It is
centered on the bar’s horizontal midpoint.
The second plot shows the result of plotting the same values, but without using special
care to break the line. What’s happening here is that the thin blue line of the plain plot()
call is automatically bridged over na values (or gaps), so the plot does not interrupt.
We then plot navy blue crosses and circles on the body tops and bottoms. The
plot.style_circles and plot.style_cross style are a simple way to plot discontinuous
values, e.g., for stop or take profit levels, or support & resistance levels.
The last plot in green on the bar lows is done using plot.style_stepline. Note how its
segments are wider than the fuchsia line segments plotted with plot.style_linebr. Also
note how on the last bar, it only plots halfway until the next bar comes in.
The plotting order of each plot is controlled by their order of appearance in the script.
See
This script shows how you can restrict plotting to bars after a user-defined date. We use the
input.time() function to create an input widget allowing script users to select a date and time,
using Jan 1st 2021 as its default value:
Color control
The Conditional coloring section of the page on colors discusses color control for plots. We’ll
look here at a few examples.
The value of the color parameter in plot() can be a constant, such as one of the built-in
constant colors or a color literal. In Pine Script™, the qualified type of such colors is called
“const color” (see the Type system page). They are known at compile time:
The color of a plot can also be determined using information that is only known when the
script begins execution on the first historical bar of a chart (bar zero, i.e., bar_index == 0 or
barstate.isfirst == true ), as will be the case when the information needed to determine a
color depends on the chart the script is running on. Here, we calculate a plot color using the
syminfo.type built-in variable, which returns the type of the chart’s symbol. The qualified type
of plotColor in this case will be “simple color”:
Plot colors can also be chosen through a script’s inputs. In this case, the lineColorInput
variable is of the “input color” type:
Finally, plot colors can also be dynamic values, i.e., calculated values that can change on each
bar. These values are of the “series color” type:
When plotting pivot levels, one common requirement is to avoid plotting level transitions.
Using lines is one alternative, but you can also use plot() like this:
Note that:
We use pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3)) to hold our pivot values. Because
ta.pivothigh() only returns a value when a new pivot is found, we use fixnan() to fill the
gaps with the last pivot value returned. The gaps here refer to the na values
ta.pivothigh() returns when no new pivot is found.
Our pivots are detected three bars after they occur because we use the argument 3 for
both the leftbars and rightbars parameters in our ta.pivothigh() call.
The last plot is plotting a continuous value, but it is setting the plot’s color to na when
the pivot’s value changes, so the plot isn’t visible then. Because of this, a visible plot will
only appear on the bar following the one where we plotted using na color.
The blue dot indicates when a new high pivot is detected and no plot is drawn between
the preceding bar and that one. Note how the pivot on the bar indicated by the arrow
has just been detected in the realtime bar, three bars later, and how no plot is drawn.
The plot will only appear on the next bar, making the plot visible four bars after the
actual pivot.
Levels
Pine Script™ has an hline() function to plot horizontal lines (see the page on Levels). hline() is
useful because it has some line styles unavailable with plot(), but it also has some limitations,
namely that it does not accept “series color”, and that its price parameter requires an “input
int/float”, so cannot vary during the script’s execution.
You can plot levels with plot() in a few different ways. This shows a CCI indicator with levels
plotted using plot():
Note that:
The zero level is plotted using plot.style_circles.
The 100 levels are plotted using a conditional value that only plots every second bar. In
order to prevent the na values from being bridged, we use the plot.style_linebr line style.
The 200 levels are plotted using trackprice = true to plot a distinct pattern of small
squares that extends the full width of the script’s visual space. The show_last = 1 in
there displays only the last plotted value, which would appear as a one-bar straight line
if the next trick wasn’t also used: the offset = -99999 pushes that one-bar segment
far away in the past so that it is never visible.
The 300 levels are plotted using a continuous line, but a lighter transparency is used to
make them less prominent.
Offsets
The offset parameter specifies the shift used when the line is plotted (negative values shift
in the past, positive values shift into the future). For example:
As can be seen in the screenshot, the red series has been shifted to the left (since the
argument’s value is negative), while the green series has been shifted to the right (its value is
positive).
Plot count limit
Each script is limited to a maximum plot count of 64. All plot*() calls and alertcondition()
calls count in the plot count of a script. Some types of calls count for more than one in the
total plot count.
plot() calls count for one in the total plot count if they use a “const color” argument for the
color parameter, which means it is known at compile time, e.g.:
When they use another qualified type, such as any one of these, they will count for two in the
total plot count:
Scale
Not all values can be plotted everywhere. Your script’s visual space is always bound by upper
and lower limits that are dynamically adjusted with the values plotted. An RSI indicator will
plot values between 0 and 100, which is why it is usually displayed in a distinct pane — or area
— above or below the chart. If RSI values were plotted as an overlay on the chart, the effect
would be to distort the symbol’s normal price scale, unless it just hapenned to be close to
RSI’s 0 to 100 range. This shows an RSI signal line and a centerline at the 50 level, with the
script running in a separate pane:
Note that the y axis of our script’s visual space is automatically sized using the range of
values plotted, i.e., the values of RSI. See the page on Colors for more information on the
color.from_gradient() function used in the script.
If we try to plot the symbol’s close values in the same space by adding the following line to
our script:
This is what happens:
The chart is on the BTCUSD symbol, whose close prices are around 40000 during this period.
Plotting values in the 40000 range makes our RSI plots in the 0 to 100 range indiscernible.
The same distorted plots would occur if we placed the RSI indicator on the chart as an
overlay.
Merging two indicators
If you are planning to merge two signals in one script, first consider the scale of each. It is
impossible, for example, to correctly plot an RSI and a MACD in the same script’s visual space
because RSI has a fixed range (0 to 100) while MACD doesn’t, as it plots moving averages
calculated on price._
If both your indicators used fixed ranges, you can shift the values of one of them so they do
not overlap. We could, for example, plot both RSI (0 to 100) and the True Strength Indicator
(TSI) (-100 to +100) by displacing one of them. Our strategy here will be to compress and
shift the TSI values so they plot over RSI:
Note that:
We have added levels using hline to situate both signals.
In order for both signal lines to oscillate on the same range of 100, we divide the TSI
value by 2 because it has a 200 range (-100 to +100). We then shift this value up by 150
so it oscillates between 100 and 200, making 150 its centerline.
The manipulations we make here are typical of the compromises required to bring two
indicators with different scales in the same visual space, even when their values,
contrary to MACD, are bounded in a fixed range.

User Manual / Concepts / Repainting
Repainting
Introduction
We define repainting as: script behavior causing historical vs realtime calculations or
plots to behave differently.
Repainting behavior is widespread and many factors can cause it. Following our definition, our
estimate is that more than 95% of indicators in existence exhibit some form of repainting
behavior. Commony used indicators such as MACD and RSI, for example, show confirmed
values on historical bars, but will fluctuate on a realtime, unconfirmed chart bar until it closes.
Therefore, they behave differently in historical and realtime states.
Not all repainting behavior is inherently useless or misleading, nor does such behavior
prevent knowledgeable traders from using indicators with such behavior. For example, who
would think of discrediting a volume profile indicator solely because it updates its values on
realtime bars?
One may encounter any of the following forms of repainting in the scripts they use, depending
on what a script’s calculations entail:
Widespread but often acceptable: A script may use values that update with realtime
price changes on the unconfirmed bar. For example, if one uses the close variable in
calculations performed on an open chart bar, its values will reflect the most recent price
in the bar. However, the script will only commit a new data point to its historical series
once the bar closes. Another common case is using request.security() to fetch highertimeframe
data on realtime bars, as explained in the Historical and realtime behavior
section of the Other timeframes and data page. As with the unconfirmed chart bar in the
chart’s timeframe, request.security() can track unconfirmed values from a highertimeframe
context on realtime bars, which can lead to repainting after the script restarts
its execution. There is often nothing wrong with using such scripts, provided you
understand how they work. When electing to use such scripts to issue alerts or trade
orders, however, it’s important to understand the difference between their realtime and
historical behavior and decide for yourself whether it provides utility for your needs.
Potentially misleading: Scripts that plot values into the past, calculate results on
realtime bars that one cannot replicate on historical bars, or relocate past events are
potentially misleading. For example, Ichimoku, most scripts based on pivots, most
strategies using calc_on_every_tick = true , scripts using request.security() when it
behaves differently on realtime bars, many scripts using varip, many scripts using
timenow, and some scripts that use barstate.* variables can exhibit misleading
repainting behavior.
Unacceptable: Scripts that leak future information into the past, strategies that execute
on non-standard charts, and scripts using realtime intrabars to generate alerts or
orders, are examples that can produce heavily misleading repainting behavior.
Unavoidable: Revisions of the data feed from a provider and variations in the starting
bar of the chart’s history can cause repainting behavior that may be unavoidable in a
script.
The first two types of repainting can be perfectly acceptable if:
1. You are aware of the behavior.
2. You can live with it, or
3. You can circumvent it.
It should now be clear that not all repainting behavior is wrong and requires avoiding at all
costs. In many situations, some forms of repainting may be exactly what a script needs.
What’s important is to know when repainting behavior is not acceptable for one’s needs. To
avoid repainting that’s not acceptable, it’s important to understand how a tool works or how
you should design the tools you build. If you publish scripts, ensure you mention any
potentially misleading behavior along with the other limitations of your script in the
publication’s description.
For script users
One can decide to use repainting indicators if they understand the behavior, and whether that
behavior meets their analysis requirements. Don’t be one of those newcomers who slap
“repaint” sentences on published scripts in an attempt to discredit them, as doing so reveals
a lack of foundational knowledge on the subject.
Simply asking whether a script repaints is relatively meaningless, given that there are forms of
repainting behavior that are perfectly acceptable in a script. Therefore, such a question will
not beget a meaningful answer. One should instead ask specific questions about a script’s
potential repainting behavior, such as:
Does the script calculate/display in the same way on historical and realtime bars?
Do alerts from the script wait for the end of a realtime bar before triggering?
Do signal markers shown by the script wait for the end of a realtime bar before showing?
Does the script plot/draw values into the past?
Does the strategy use calc_on_every_tick = true ?
Do the script’s request.security() calls leak future information into the past on historical
bars?
What’s important is that you understand how the tools you use work, and whether their
behavior is compatible with your objectives, repainting or not. As you will learn if you read this
page, repainting is a complex matter. It has many faces and many causes. Even if you don’t
program in Pine Script™, this page will help you understand the array of causes that can lead
to repainting, and hopefully enable more meaningful discussions with script authors.
For Pine Script™ programmers
As discussed above, not all forms of repainting behavior must be avoided at all costs, nor is all
potential repainting behavior necessarily avoidable. We hope this page helps you better
understand the dynamics at play so that you can design your trading tools with these
behaviors in mind. This page’s content should help make you aware of common coding
mistakes that produce misleading repainting results.
Whatever your design decisions are, if you publish your script, explain the script to traders so
they can understand how it behaves.
This page covers three broad categories of repainting causes:
Historical vs realtime calculations
Plotting in the past
Dataset variations
Historical vs realtime calculations
Fluid data values
Historical data does not include records of intermediary price movements on bars; only open,
high, low and close values (OHLC).
On realtime bars (bars running when the instrument’s market is open), however, the high, low
and close values are not fixed; they can change values many times before the realtime bar
closes and its HLC values are fixed. They are fluid. This leads to a script sometimes working
differently on historical data and in real time, where only the open price will not change during
the bar.
Any script using values like high, low and close in realtime is subject to producing calculations
that may not be repeatable on historical bars — thus repaint.
Let’s look at this simple script. It detects crosses of the close value (in the realtime bar, this
corresponds to the current price of the instrument) over and under an EMA:
Note that:
The script uses bgcolor() to color the background green when close crosses over the
EMA, and red on crosses under the EMA.
The screen snapshot shows the script in realtime on a 30sec chart. A cross over the
EMA has been detected, thus the background of the realtime bar is green.
The problem here is that nothing guarantees this condition will hold true until the end of
the realtime bar. The arrow points to the timer showing that 21 seconds remain in the
realtime bar, and anything could happen until then.
We are witnessing a repainting script.
To prevent this repainting, we must rewrite our script so that it does not use values that
fluctuate during the realtime bar. This will require using values from a bar that has elapsed
(typically the preceding bar), or the open price, which does not vary in realtime.
We can achieve this in many ways. This method adds a and barstate.isconfirmed condition
to our cross detections, which requires the script to be executing on the bar’s last iteration,
when it closes and prices are confirmed. It is a simple way to avoid repainting:
This uses the crosses detected on the previous bar:
This uses only confirmed close and EMA values for its calculations:
This detects crosses between the realtime bar’s open and the value of the EMA from the
previous bars. Notice that the EMA is calculated using close, so it repaints. We must ensure
we use a confirmed value to detect crosses, thus ma[1] in the cross detection logic:
All these methods have one thing in common: while they prevent repainting, they will
also trigger signals later than repainting scripts. This is an inevitable compromise if one
wants to avoid repainting. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
Repainting `request.security()` calls
The request.security() function behaves differently on historical and realtime bars. On
historical bars, it only returns confirmed values from its requested context, wheras it can
return unconfirmed values on realtime bars. When the script restarts its execution, the bars
that had a realtime state become historical bars, and will therefore only contain the values it
confirmed on those bars. If the values returned by request.security() fluctuate on realtime
bars without confirmation from the context, the script will repaint them when it restarts its
execution. See the Historical and realtime behavior section of the Other timeframes and data
page for a detailed explanation.
One can ensure higher-timeframe data requests only return confirmed values on all bars,
regardless of bar state, by offsetting the expression argument by at least one bar with the
history-referencing operator [] and using barmerge.lookahead_on for the lookahead
argument in the request.security() call, as explained here.
The script below demonstrates the difference between repainting and non-repainting HTF
data requests. It contains two request.security() calls. The first function call requests close
data from the higherTimeframe without additional specification, and the second call requests
the same series with an offset and barmerge.lookahead_on.
As we see on all realtime bars (the ones with an orange background), the repaintingClose
contains values that fluctuate without confirmation from the higherTimeframe , meaning it will
repaint when the script restarts its execution. The nonRepaintingClose , on the other hand,
behaves the same on realtime and historical bars, i.e., it only changes its value when new,
confirmed data is available:
Note that:
We used the plotshape() function to mark the chart when there’s a change on the
higherTimeframe .
This script produces a runtime error if the higherTimeframe is lower than the chart’s
timeframe.
On historical bars, the repaintingClose has a new value at the end of each timeframe,
and the nonRepaintingClose has a new value at the start of each timeframe.
For the sake of easy reusability, below is a simple a noRepaintSecurity() function that one
can apply in their scripts to request non-repainting higher-timeframe values:
Note that:
The [1] offset to the series and the use of lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on are
interdependent. One cannot be removed without compromising the integrity of the
function.
Unlike a plain request.security() call, this wrapper function cannot accept tuple
expression arguments. For multi-element use cases, one can pass a user-defined type
whose fields contain the desired elements to request.
Using `request.security()` at lower timeframes
Some scripts use request.security() to request data from a timeframe lower than the chart’s
timeframe. This can be useful when functions specifically designed to handle intrabars at
lower timeframes are sent down the timeframe. When this type of user-defined function
requires the detection of the intrabars’ first bar, as most do, the technique will only work on
historical bars. This is due to the fact that realtime intrabars are not yet sorted. The impact of
this is that such scripts cannot reproduce in real time their behavior on historical bars. Any
logic generating alerts, for example, will be flawed, and constant refreshing will be required to
recalculate elapsed realtime bars as historical bars.
When used at lower timeframes than the chart’s without specialized functions able to
distinguish between intrabars, request.security() will only return the value of the last intrabar
in the dilation of the chart’s bar, which is usually not useful, and will also not reproduce in real
time, so lead to repainting.
For all these reasons, unless you understand the subtleties of using request.security() at
lower timeframes than the chart’s, it is best to avoid using the function at those timeframes.
Higher-quality scripts will have logic to detect such anomalies and prevent the display of
results which would be invalid when a lower timeframe is used.
For more reliable lower-timeframe data requests, use request.security_lower_tf(), as
explained in this section of the Other timeframes and data page.
Future leak with `request.security()`
When request.security() is used with lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on to fetch prices
without offsetting the series by [1] , it will return data from the future on historical bars,
which is dangerously misleading.
While historical bars will magically display future prices before they should be known, no
lookahead is possible in realtime because the future there is unknown, as it should, so no
future bars exist.
This is an example:
Note how the higher timeframe line is showing the timeframe’s high value before it occurs.
The solution to avoid this effect is to use the function as demonstrated in this section.
Using lookahead to produce misleading results is not allowed in script publications, as
explained in the lookahead section of the Other timeframes and data page. Script publications
that use this misleading technique will be moderated.
`varip`
Scripts using the varip declaration mode for variables (see our section on varip for more
information) save information across realtime updates, which cannot be reproduced on
historical bars where only OHLC information is available. Such scripts may be useful in
realtime, including to generate alerts, but their logic cannot be backtested, nor can their plots
on historical bars reflect calculations that will be done in realtime.
Bar state built-ins
Scripts using bar states may or may not repaint. As we have seen in the previous section,
using barstate.isconfirmed is actually one way to avoid repainting that will reproduce on
historical bars, which are always “confirmed”. Uses of other bar states such as barstate.isnew,
however, will lead to repainting. The reason is that on historical bars, barstate.isnew is true
on the bar’s close, yet in realtime, it is true on the bar’s open. Using the other bar state
variables will usually cause some type of behavioral discrepancy between historical and
realtime bars.
`timenow`
The timenow built-in returns the current time. Scripts using this variable cannot show
consistent historical and realtime behavior, so they necessarily repaint.
Strategies
Strategies using calc_on_every_tick = true execute on each realtime update, while
strategies run on the close of historical bars. They will most probably not generate the same
order executions, and so repaint. Note that when this happens, it also invalidates backtesting
results, as they are not representative of the strategy’s behavior in realtime.
Plotting in the past
Scripts detecting pivots after 5 bars have elapsed will often go back in the past to plot pivot
levels or values on the actual pivot, 5 bars in the past. This will often cause unsuspecting
traders looking at plots on historical bars to infer that when the pivot happens in realtime, the
same plots will apppear on the pivot when it occurs, as opposed to when it is detected.
Let’s look at a script showing the price of high pivots by placing the price in the past, 5 bars
after the pivot was detected:
Note that:
This script repaints because an elapsed realtime bar showing no price may get a price
placed on it if it is identified as a pivot, 5 bars after the actual pivot occurs.
The display looks great, but it can be misleading.
The best solution to this problem when developing script for others is to plot without an
offset by default, but give the option for script users to turn on plotting in the past through
inputs, so they are necessarily aware of what the script is doing, e.g.:
Dataset variations
Starting points
Scripts begin executing on the chart’s first historical bar, and then execute on each bar
sequentially, as is explained in this manual’s page on Pine Script™‘s execution model. If the
first bar changes, then the script will often not calculate the same way it did when the dataset
began at a different point in time.
The following factors have an impact on the quantity of bars you see on your charts, and their
starting point:
The type of account you hold
The historical data available from the data supplier
The alignment requirements of the dataset, which determine its starting point
These are the account-specific bar limits:
40000 historical bars for the Ultimate plan.
30000 historical bars for the Elite plan.
25000 historical bars for the Expert plan.
20000 historical bars for the Premium plan.
10000 historical bars for Essential and Plus plans.
5000 historical bars for other plans.
Starting points are determined using the following rules, which depend on the chart’s
timeframe:
Tick-based timeframes: return the exact number of bars based on the plan.
Second-based timeframes: aligns to the beginning of a day.
1 - 14 minutes: aligns to the beginning of a week.
15 - 29 minutes: aligns to the beginning of a month.
30 - 1439 minutes: aligns to the beginning of a year.
1440 minutes and higher: aligns to the first available historical data point.
As time goes by, these factors cause your chart’s history to start at different points in time.
This often has an impact on your scripts calculations, because changes in calculation results
in early bars can ripple through all the other bars in the dataset. Using functions like
ta.valuewhen(), ta.barssince() or ta.ema(), for example, will yield results that vary with early
history.
Revision of historical data
Historical and realtime bars are built using two different data feeds supplied by
exchanges/brokers: historical data, and realtime data. When realtime bars elapse,
exchanges/brokers sometimes make what are usually small adjustments to bar prices, which
are then written to their historical data. When the chart is refreshed or the script is reexecuted
on those elapsed realtime bars, they will then be built and calculated using the
historical data, which will contain those usually small price revisions, if any have been made.
Historical data may also be revised for other reasons, e.g., for stock splits.

Introduction
Session information is usable in three different ways in Pine Script™:
1. Session strings containing from-to start times and day information that can be used in
functions such as time() and time_close() to detect when bars are in a particular time
period, with the option of limiting valid sessions to specific days. The input.session()
function provides a way to allow script users to define session values through a script’s
“Inputs” tab (see the Session input section for more information).
2. Session states built-in variables such as session.ismarket can identify which session a
bar belongs to.
3. When fetching data with request.security() you can also choose to return data from
regular sessions only or extended sessions. In this case, the definition of regular and
extended sessions is that of the exchange. It is part of the instrument’s properties —
not user-defined, as in point #1. This notion of regular and extended sessions is the
same one used in the chart’s interface, in the “Chart Settings/Symbol/Session” field, for
example.
The following sections cover both methods of using session information in Pine Script™.
Note that:
Not all user accounts on TradingView have access to extended session information.
There is no special “session” type in Pine Script™. Instead, session strings are of
“string” type but must conform to the session string syntax.
Session strings
Session string specifications
Session strings used with time() and time_close() must have a specific format. Their syntax is:
Where:
- <time_period> uses times in “hhmm” format, with “hh” in 24-hour format, so 1700 for 5PM.
The time periods are in the “hhmm-hhmm” format, and a comma can separate multiple time
periods to specify combinations of discrete periods.
For example, - <days> is a set of digits from 1 to 7 that specifies on which days the session is
valid.
1 is Sunday, 7 is Saturday.
These are examples of session strings:
"24x7"
A 7-day, 24-hour session beginning at midnight.
"0000-0000:1234567"
Equivalent to the previous example.
"0000-0000"
Equivalent to the previous two examples because the default days are 1234567 .
"0000-0000:23456"
The same as the previous example, but only Monday to Friday.
"2000-1630:1234567"
An overnight session that begins at 20:00 and ends at 16:30 the next day. It is valid on all
days of the week.
"0930-1700:146"
A session that begins at 9:30 and ends at 17:00 on Sundays (1), Wednesdays (4), and
Fridays (6).
"1700-1700:23456"
An overnight session. The Monday session starts Sunday at 17:00 and ends Monday at
17:00. It is valid Monday through Friday.
"1000-1001:26"
A weird session that lasts only one minute on Mondays (2) and Fridays (6).
"0900-1600,1700-2000"
A session that begins at 9:00, breaks from 16:00 to 17:00, and continues until 20:00.
Applies to every day of the week.
Using session strings
Session properties defined with session strings are independent of the exchange-defined
sessions determining when an instrument can be traded. Programmers have complete liberty
in creating whatever session definitions suit their purpose, which is usually to detect when
bars belong to specific time periods. This is accomplished in Pine Script™ by using one of the
following two signatures of the time() function:
Here, we use time() with a session argument to display the market’s opening high and low
values on an intraday chart:
Note that:
We use a session input to allow users to specify the time they want to detect. We are
only looking for the session’s beginning time on bars, so we use a five-minute gap
between the beginning and end time of our "0930-0935" default value.
We create a sessionBegins() function to detect the beginning of a session. Its
time("", sess) call uses an empty string for the function’s timeframe parameter,
which means it uses the chart’s timeframe, whatever that is. The function returns true
when:
The chart uses an intraday timeframe (seconds or minutes).
The script isn’t on the chart’s first bar, which we ensure with (not
barstate.isfirst) . This check prevents the code from always detecting a session
beginning on the first bar because na(t[1]) and not na(t) is always true there.
The time() call has returned na on the previous bar because it wasn’t in the
session’s time period, and it has returned a value that is not na on the current bar,
which means the bar is in the session’s time period.
Session states
Three built-in variables allow you to distinguish the type of session the current bar belongs to.
They are only helpful on intraday timeframes:
session.ismarket returns true when the bar belongs to regular trading hours.
session.ispremarket returns true when the bar belongs to the extended session
preceding regular trading hours.
session.ispostmarket returns true when the bar belongs to the extended session
following regular trading hours.
Using sessions with `request.security()`
When your TradingView account provides access to extended sessions, you can choose to
see their bars with the “Settings/Symbol/Session” field. There are two types of sessions:
regular (which does not include pre- and post-market data), and
extended (which includes pre- and post-market data).
Scripts using the request.security() function to access data can return extended session data
or not. This is an example where only regular session data is fetched:
If you want the request.security() call to return extended session data, you must first use the
ticker.new() function to build the first argument of the request.security() call:
Note that the previous chart’s gaps in the script’s plot are now filled. Also, keep in mind that
our example scripts do not produce the background coloring on the chart; it is due to the
chart’s settings showing extended hours.
The ticker.new() function has the following signature:
Where:
prefix is the exchange prefix, e.g., "NASDAQ"
ticker is a symbol name, e.g., "AAPL"
session can be session.extended or session.regular . Note that this is not a session
string.
adjustment adjusts prices using different criteria: adjustment.none ,
adjustment.splits , adjustment.dividends .
Our first example could be rewritten as:
If you want to use the same session specifications used for the chart’s main symbol, omit the
third argument in ticker.new(); it is optional. If you want your code to declare your intention
explicitly, use the syminfo.session built-in variable. It holds the session type of the chart’s
main symbol:

User Manual / Concepts / Strategies Strategies Introduction Pine Script™ Strategies are specialized scripts that simulate trades across historical and realtime bars, allowing users to backtest and forward test their trading systems. Strategy scripts have many of the same capabilities as indicator scripts, and they provide the ability to place, modify, and cancel hypothetical orders and analyze performance results. When a script uses the strategy() function as its declaration statement, it gains access to the strategy.* namespace, which features numerous functions and variables for simulating orders and retrieving essential strategy information. It also displays relevant information and simulated performance results in the dedicated Strategy Tester tab. A simple strategy example The following script is a simple strategy that simulates entering a long or short position when two moving averages cross. When the fastMA crosses above the slowMA , it places a “buy” market order to enter a long position. When the fastMA crosses below the slowMA , it places a “sell” market order to enter a short position: Note that: The strategy() function call declares that the script is a strategy named “Simple strategy demo” that displays visuals on the main chart pane. The margin_long and margin_short arguments in the strategy() call specify that the strategy must have 100% of a long or short trade’s amount available to allow the trade. See this section for more information. The strategy.entry() function is the command that the script uses to create entry orders and reverse positions. The “buy” entry order closes any short position and opens a new long position. The “sell” entry order closes any long position and opens a new short position. Applying a strategy to a chart To test a strategy, add it to the chart. Select a built-in or published strategy from the “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” menu, or write a custom strategy in the Pine Editor and click the “Add to chart” option in the top-right corner: The script plots trade markers on the main chart pane and displays simulated performance results inside the Strategy Tester tab: Strategy Tester The Strategy Tester visualizes the hypothetical performance of a strategy script and displays its properties. To use it, add a script declared with the strategy() function to the chart, then open the “Strategy Tester” tab. If two or more strategies are on the chart, specify which one to analyze by selecting its name in the top-left corner. After the selected script executes across the chart’s data, the Strategy Tester populates the following four tabs with relevant strategy information: Overview Performance Summary List of Trades Properties Overview The Overview tab provides a quick look into a strategy’s performance over a sequence of simulated trades. This tab displays essential performance metrics and a chart with three helpful plots: The Equity baseline plot visualizes the strategy’s simulated equity across closed trades. The Drawdown column plot shows how far the strategy’s equity fell below its peak across trades. The Buy & hold equity plot shows the equity growth of a strategy that enters a single long position and holds that position throughout the testing range. Note that: The chart has two separate vertical scales. The “Equity” and “Buy & hold equity” plots use the scale on the left, and the “Drawdown” plot uses the scale on the right. Users can toggle the plots and choose between absolute or percentage scales using the options at the bottom. When a user clicks on a point in this chart, the main chart scrolls to the corresponding bar where the trade closed and displays a tooltip containing the closing time. Performance Summary The Performance Summary tab presents an in-depth summary of a strategy’s key performance metrics, organized into separate columns. The “All” column shows performance information for all simulated trades, and the “Long” and “Short” columns show relevant metrics separately for long and short trades. This view provides more detailed insights into a strategy’s overall and directional trading performance: List of Trades The List of Trades tab chronologically lists a strategy’s simulated trades. Each item in the list displays vital information about a trade, including the dates and times of entry and exit orders, the names of the orders, the order prices, and the number of contracts/shares/lots/units. In addition, each item shows the trade’s profit or loss and the strategy’s cumulative profit, run- up, and drawdown: Note that: Hovering the mouse over a list item’s entry or exit information reveals a “Scroll to bar” button. Clicking that button navigates the main chart to the bar where the entry or exit occurred. The list shows each trade in descending order by default, with the latest trade at the top. Users can reverse this order by clicking the “Trade #” button above the list. Properties The “Properties” tab provides detailed information about a strategy’s configuration and the dataset that it executes across, organized into four collapsible sections: The “Date Range” section shows the range of dates that had simulated trades, and the overall available backtesting range. The “Symbol Info” section displays the chart’s symbol, timeframe, type, point value, currency, and tick size. It also includes the chart’s specified precision setting. The “Strategy Inputs” section lists the names and values of all the inputs available in the strategy’s “Settings/Inputs” tab. This section only appears if the script includes input* () calls or specifies a nonzero calc_bars_count argument in the strategy() declaration statement. The “Strategy Properties” section provides an overview of the strategy’s properties, including the initial capital, account currency, order size, margin, pyramiding, commission, slippage, and other settings. Broker emulator TradingView uses a broker emulator to simulate trades while running a strategy script. Unlike in real-world trading, the emulator fills a strategy’s orders exclusively using available chart data by default. Consequently, it executes orders on historical bars after a bar closes. Similarly, the earliest point that it can fill orders on realtime bars is after a new price tick. For more information about this behavior, see the Execution model page. Because the broker emulator only uses price data from the chart by default, it makes assumptions about intrabar price movement when filling orders. The emulator analyzes the opening, high, low, and closing prices of chart bars to infer intrabar activity using the following logic:If the opening price of a bar is closer to the high than the low, the emulator assumes that the market price moved in this order: open → high → low → close. If the opening price of a bar is closer to the low than the high, the emulator assumes that the market price moved in this order: open → low → high → close. The emulator assumes no gaps exist between intrabars inside each chart bar, meaning it considers any value within a bar’s high-low range as a valid price for order execution. When filling price-based orders (all orders except market orders), the emulator assumes intrabars do not exist within the gap between the previous bar’s close and the current bar’s open. If the market price crosses an order’s price during the gap between two bars, the emulator fills the order at the current bar’s open and not at the specified price. Bar magnifier Users with Premium and higher-tier plans can override the broker emulator’s default assumptions about intrabar prices by enabling the Bar Magnifier backtesting mode. In this mode, the emulator uses data from lower timeframes to obtain more granular information about price action within bars, allowing more precise order fills in the strategy’s simulation. To enable the Bar Magnifier mode, include use_bar_magnifier = true in the strategy() declaration statement, or select the “Using bar magnifier” option in the “Fill orders” section of the strategy’s “Settings/Properties” tab. The following example script illustrates how the Bar Magnifier can enhance order-fill behavior. When the time value crosses the defined orderTime , it creates “Buy” and “Exit” limit orders at the calculated entryPrice and exitPrice . For visual reference, the script colors the background orange when it places the orders, and it draws two horizontal lines at the order prices: Because the script does not include a use_bar_magnifier argument in the strategy() function, the broker emulator uses the default assumptions when filling the orders: that the bar’s price moved from open to high, high to low, and then low to close. Therefore, after filling the “Buy” order at the price indicated by the green line, the broker emulator inferred that the market price did not go back up to touch the red line and trigger the “Exit” order. In other words, the strategy could not enter and exit the position on the same bar according to the broker emulator’s assumptions. After we enable the Bar Magnifier mode, the broker emulator can access 10-minute data on the 60-minute chart instead of relying on its assumptions about hourly bars. On this timeframe, the market price did move back up to the “Exit” order’s price after reaching the “Buy” order’s price in the same hour. Therefore, with the Bar Magnifier enabled in this scenario, both orders execute on the same hourly bar: Orders and trades Pine Script™ strategies use orders to make trades and manage positions, similar to real-world trading. In this context, an order is an instruction that a strategy sends to the broker emulator to perform a market action, and a trade is the resulting transaction after the emulator fills an order. Let’s take a closer look at how strategy orders work and how they become trades. Every 20 bars, the following script creates a long market order with strategy.entry() and draws a label. It calls strategy.close_all() on each bar from the global scope to generate a market order to close any open position: Note that: Although the script calls strategy.close_all() on every bar, the function only creates a new exit order when the strategy has an open position. If there is no open position, the function call has no effect. The blue arrows on the above chart show where the strategy entered a long position, and the purple arrows mark the bars where the strategy closed the position. Notice that the label drawings appear one bar before the entry markers, and the entry markers appear one bar before the closing markers. This sequence illustrates order creation and execution in action. By default, the earliest point the broker emulator fills an order is on the next available price tick, because creating and filling an order on the same tick is unrealistic. Since strategies recalculate after each bar closes by default, the next available tick where the emulator fills a generated order is at the open of the following bar. For example, when the longCondition occurs on bar 20, the script places an entry order to fill on the next tick, which is at the open of bar 21. When the strategy recalculates its values after bar 21 closes, it places an order to close the current position on the next tick, which is at the open of bar 22. Order types Pine Script™ strategies can simulate different order types to suit specific trading system needs. The main notable order types include market, limit, stop, and stop-limit. Market orders A market order is the simplest type of order, which most order placement commands generate by default. A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a security as soon as possible, irrespective of the price. As such, the broker emulator always executes a market order on the next available tick. The example below alternates between placing a long and short market order once every lengthInput bars. When the bar_index is divisible by 2 * lengthInput , the strategy generates a long market order. Otherwise, it places a short market order when the bar_index is divisible by the lengthInput : Note that: The labels indicate the bars where the script generates the market orders. The broker emulator fills each order at the open of the following bar. The strategy.entry() command can automatically reverse an open position in the opposite direction. See this section below for more information. Limit orders A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better (lower than specified for long orders, and higher than specified for short orders), irrespective of the time. To simulate a limit order in a strategy script, pass a price value to the limit parameter of an applicable order placement command. When the market price reaches a limit order’s value, or crosses it in the favorable direction, the broker emulator fills the order at that value or a better price. When a strategy generates a limit order at a worse value than the current market price (higher for long orders and lower for short orders), the emulator fills the order without waiting for the market price to reach that value. For example, the following script generates a long limit order 800 ticks below the close of the bar 100 bars before the last chart bar using the strategy.entry() command. It draws a label to signify the bar where the strategy created the order and a line to visualize the order’s price: Notice that in the chart above, the label and the start of the line occurred several bars before the “Long” entry marker. The broker emulator could not fill the order while the market price remained above the limitPrice because such a price is a worse value for the long trade. After the price fell and reached the limitPrice , the emulator filled the order mid-bar at that value. If we set the limitPrice to a value above the bar’s close rather than below, the broker emulator fills the order at the open of the following bar because the closing price is already a more favorable value for the long trade. Here, we set the limitPrice in the script to 800 ticks above the bar’s close to demonstrate this effect: Stop and stop-limit orders A stop order is an instruction to activate a new market or limit order when the market price reaches a specific price or a worse value (higher than specified for long orders and lower than specified for short orders). To simulate a stop order, pass a price value to the stop parameter of an applicable order placement command. When a strategy generates a stop order at a better value than the current market price, it activates the subsequent order without waiting for the market price to reach that value. The following example calls strategy.entry() to place a stop order 800 ticks above the close 100 bars before the last historical chart bar. It also draws a label on the bar where it created the order and a line to display the stop price. As we see in the chart below, the strategy entered a long position immediately after the price crossed the stop level: Note that: A basic stop order is essentially the opposite of a limit order in terms of its execution based on the market price. If we use a limit order instead of a stop order in this scenario, the order executes immediately on the next bar. See the previous section for an example. When a strategy.entry() or strategy.order() call includes a stop and limit argument, it creates a stop-limit order. Unlike a basic stop order, which triggers a market order when the current price is at the stop level or a worse value, a stop-limit order creates a subsequent limit order to fill at the specified limit price. Below, we modified the previous script to simulate and visualize a stop-limit order. This script version includes the bar’s low as the limit price in the strategy.entry() command. It also includes additional drawings to show where the strategy activated the subsequent limit order and to visualize the limit price. In this example chart, notice how the market price reached the limit level on the next bar after the stop-limit order was created, but the strategy did not enter a position because the limit order was not yet active. After price later reached the stop level, the strategy placed the limit order, and then the broker emulator filled it after the market price dropped back down to the limit level: Order placement and cancellation The strategy.* namespace features the following five functions that simulate the placement of orders, known as order placement commands: strategy.entry(), strategy.order(), strategy.exit(), strategy.close(), and strategy.close_all(). Additionally, the namespace includes the following two functions that cancel pending orders, known as order cancellation commands: strategy.cancel() and strategy.cancel_all(). The segments below explain these commands, their unique characteristics, and how to use them. `strategy.entry()` The strategy.entry() command generates entry orders. Its unique features help simplify opening and managing positions. This order placement command generates market orders by default. It can also create limit, stop, and stop-limit orders with the limit and stop parameters, as explained in the Order types section above. Reversing positions One of the strategy.entry() command’s unique features is its ability to reverse an open position automatically. By default, when an order from strategy.entry() executes while there is an open position in the opposite direction, the command automatically adds the position’s size to the new order’s size. The added quantity allows the order to close the current position and open a new position for the specified number of contracts/lots/shares/units in the new direction. For instance, if a strategy has an open position of 15 shares in the strategy.long direction and calls strategy.entry() to place a new market order in the strategy.short direction, the size of the resulting transaction is the specified entry size plus 15 shares. The example below demonstrates this behavior in action. When the buyCondition occurs once every 100 bars, the script calls strategy.entry() with qty = 15 to open a long position of 15 shares. Otherwise, when the sellCondition occurs on every 50th bar, the script calls strategy.entry() with qty = 5 to enter a new short position of five shares. The script also highlights the chart’s background on the bars where the buyCondition and sellCondition occurs: The trade markers on the chart show the transaction size, not the size of the resulting position. The markers above show that the transaction size was 20 shares on each order fill rather than 15 for long orders and five for short orders. Since strategy.entry() reverses a position in the opposite direction by default, each call adds the open position’s size (e.g., 15 for long entries) to the new order’s size (e.g., 5 for short entries), resulting in a quantity of 20 shares on each entry after the first. Although each of these transactions is 20 shares in size, the resulting positions are 5 shares for each short entry and 15 for each long entry. Note that: The strategy.risk.allow_entry_in() function overrides the allowed direction for the strategy.entry() command. When a script specifies a trade direction with this risk management command, orders from strategy.entry() in the opposite direction close the open position without allowing a reversal. Pyramiding Another unique characteristic of the strategy.entry() command is its connection to a strategy’s pyramiding property. Pyramiding specifies the maximum number of successive entries a strategy allows in the same direction. Users can set this property by including a pyramiding argument in the strategy() declaration statement or by adjusting the “Pyramiding” input in the script’s “Settings/Properties” tab. The default value is 1, meaning the strategy can open new positions but cannot add to them using orders from strategy.entry() calls. The following example uses strategy.entry() to place a market order when the entryCondition occurs on every 25th bar. The direction of the orders changes once every 100 bars, meaning every 100-bar cycle includes four strategy.entry() calls with the same direction. For visual reference of the conditions, the script highlights the chart’s background based on the current direction each time the entryCondition occurs: Notice that although the script calls strategy.entry() with the same direction four times within each 100-bar cycle, the strategy does not execute an order after every call. It cannot open more than one trade per position with strategy.entry() because it uses the default pyramiding value of 1. Below, we modified the script by including pyramiding = 4 in the strategy() declaration statement to allow up to four successive trades in the same direction. Now, an order fill occurs after every strategy.entry() call: `strategy.order()` The strategy.order() command generates a basic order. Unlike other order placement commands, which can behave differently based on a strategy’s properties and open trades, this command ignores most properties, such as pyramiding, and simply creates orders with the specified parameters. This command generates market orders by default. It can also create limit, stop, and stop-limit orders with the limit and stop parameters. Orders from strategy.order() can open new positions and modify or close existing ones. When a strategy executes an order from this command, the resulting market position is the net sum of the open position and the filled order quantity. The following script uses strategy.order() calls to enter and exit positions. The strategy places a long market order for 15 units once every 100 bars. On every 25th bar that is not a multiple of 100, it places a short market order for five units. The script highlights the background to signify where the strategy places a “buy” or “sell” order: This particular strategy never simulates a short position. Unlike the strategy.entry() command, strategy.order() does not automatically reverse open positions. After filling a “buy” order, the strategy has an open long position of 15 units. The three subsequent “sell” orders reduce the position by five units each, and 15 - 5 * 3 = 0. In other words, the strategy opens a long position on every 100th bar and gradually reduces the size to 0 using three successive short orders. If we used strategy.entry() instead of the strategy.order() command in this example, the strategy would alternate between entering long and short positions of 15 and five units, respectively. `strategy.exit()` The strategy.exit() command generates exit orders. It features several unique behaviors that link to open trades, helping to simplify closing market positions and creating multi-level exits with take-profit, stop-loss, and trailing stop orders. Unlike other order placement commands, which can generate a single order per call, each call to strategy.exit() can produce more than one type of exit order, depending on its arguments. Additionally, a single call to this command can generate exit orders for multiple entries, depending on the specified from_entry value and the strategy’s open trades. Take-profit and stop-loss The most basic use of the strategy.exit() command is the placement of limit orders to trigger exits after earning enough money (take-profit), stop orders to trigger exits after losing too much money (stop-loss), or both (bracket). Four parameters determine the prices of the command’s take-profit and stop-loss orders: The profit and loss parameters accept relative values representing the number of ticks the market price must move away from the entry price to trigger an exit. The limit and stop parameters accept absolute values representing the specific prices that trigger an exit when the market price reaches them. The absolute parameters of the strategy.exit() command supersede the relative ones. If a strategy.exit() call contains profit and limit arguments, it creates a take-profit order at the limit price and ignores the profit value. Likewise, if the call includes loss and stop arguments, the command ignores the loss value and places a stop-loss order at the stop price. The following example creates exit bracket (take-profit and stop-loss) orders with the strategy.exit() command. When the buyCondition occurs, the script calls strategy.entry() to place a “buy” market order. It also calls strategy.exit() with limit and stop arguments to create a take-profit order at the limitPrice and a stop-loss order at the stopPrice . The script plots the limitPrice and stopPrice values on the chart to visualize the exit order prices: Note that: We did not specify a qty or qty_percent argument in the strategy.exit() call, meaning it creates orders to exit 100% of the “buy” order’s size. The strategy.exit() command’s exit orders do not necessarily execute at the specified prices. Strategies can fill limit orders at better prices and stop orders at worse prices, depending on the range of values available to the broker emulator. When a strategy.exit() call includes a from_entry argument, the resulting exit orders only apply to existing entry orders that have a matching ID. If the specified from_entry value does not match the ID of any entry in the current position, the command does not create any exit orders. Below, we changed the from_entry argument of the strategy.exit() call in our previous script to “buy2”, which means it creates exit orders only for open trades with the “buy2” entry ID. This version does not place any exit orders because it does not create any entry orders with the “buy2” ID: Note that: When a strategy.exit() call does not include a from_entry argument, it creates exit orders for all the position’s open trades, regardless of their entry IDs. See the Exits for multiple entries section below to learn more. Partial and multi-level exits Strategies can use more than one call to strategy.exit() to create successive partial exit orders for the same entry ID, helping to simplify the formation of multi-level exit strategies. To use multiple strategy.exit() calls to exit from an open trade, include a qty or qty_percent argument in each call to specify how much of the traded quantity to close. If the sum of the exit order sizes exceeds the open position, the strategy automatically reduces their sizes to match the position. Note that: When a strategy.exit() call includes both qty and qty_percent arguments, the command uses the qty value to size the order and ignores the qty_percent value. This example demonstrates a simple strategy that creates two partial exit order brackets for an entry ID. When the buyCondition occurs, the script places a “buy” market order for two shares with strategy.entry(), and it creates “exit1” and “exit2” brackets using two calls to strategy.exit(). The first call uses a qty of 1, and the second uses a qty of 3: As we can see from the trade markers on the chart above, the strategy first executes the “exit1” take-profit or stop-loss order to reduce the open position by one share, leaving one remaining share in the position. However, we specified a size of three shares for the “exit2” order bracket, which exceeds the remaining position. Rather than using this specified quantity, the strategy automatically reduces the “exit2” orders to one share, allowing it to close the position successfully. Note that: This strategy only fills one exit order from the “exit1” bracket, not both. When a strategy.exit() call generates more than one exit order type for an entry ID, the strategy fills the only the first triggered one and automatically cancels the others. The strategy reduced the “exit2” orders because all orders from the strategy.exit() calls automatically belong to the same strategy.oca.reduce group by default. Learn more about OCA groups below. When creating multiple exit orders with different strategy.exit() calls, it’s crucial to note that the orders from each call reserve a portion of the open position. The orders from one strategy.exit() call cannot exit the portion of a position that a previous call already reserved. For example, this script generates a “buy” entry order for 20 shares with a strategy.entry() call and “limit” and “stop” exit orders with two separate calls to strategy.exit() 100 bars before the last chart bar. We specified a quantity of 19 shares for the “limit” order and 20 for the “stop” order: Users unfamiliar with the strategy.exit() command’s unique behaviors might expect this strategy to close the entire market position if it fills the “stop” order before the “limit” order. However, the trade markers in the chart below show that the “stop” order only reduces the position by one share. The strategy.exit() call for the “limit” order executes first in the code, reserving 19 shares of the open position for closure with that order. This reservation leaves only one share available for the “stop” order to close, regardless of when the strategy fills it: Trailing stops One of the strategy.exit() command’s key features is its ability to create trailing stops, i.e., stop-loss orders that trail behind the market price by a specified amount whenever it moves to a better value in the favorable direction (upward for long positions and downward for short positions). This type of exit order has two components: an activation level and a trail offset. The activation level is the value the market price must cross to activate the trailing stop calculation, and the trail offset is the distance the activated stop follows behind the price as it reaches successively better values. Three strategy.exit() parameters determine the activation level and trail offset of a trailing stop order: The trail_price parameter accepts an absolute price value for the trailing stop’s activation level. The trail_points parameter is an alternative way to specify the activation level. Its value represents the tick distance from the entry price required to activate the trailing stop. The trail_offset parameter accepts a value representing the order’s trail offset as a specified number of ticks. To create and activate a trailing stop order, a strategy.exit() call must include a trail_offset argument and either a trail_price or trail_points argument. If the call contains both trail_price and trail_points arguments, the command uses the trail_price for the activation level and ignores the trail_points value. The example below demonstrates how a trailing stop order works. The strategy places a “Long” market order with the strategy.entry() command 100 bars before the last chart bar, and it calls strategy.exit() with trail_price and trail_offset arguments on the following bar to create a trailing stop. The script uses lines, labels, and a plot to visualize the trailing stop’s behavior. The green line on the chart shows the level the market price must reach to activate the trailing stop order. After the price crosses this level, the script uses a blue plot to display the trailing stop’s price. Each time the market price reaches a new high after activating the trailing stop, the stop’s price increases to maintain a distance of trailOffsetInput ticks from the best value. The exit order does not change its price level when the market price decreases or does not reach a new high. Eventually, the market price crosses below the trailing stop, triggering an exit: Exits for multiple entries A single call to the strategy.exit() command can generate exit orders for more than one entry in an open position, depending on the call’s from_entry value. If an open position consists of two or more entries with the same ID, a single call to strategy.exit() with that ID as the from_entry argument places exit orders for each corresponding entry created before or on the bar where the call occurs. For example, this script periodically calls strategy.entry() on two consecutive bars to enter and add to a long position. Both calls use “buy” as the id argument. After creating the second entry, the script calls strategy.exit() once with “buy” as its from_entry argument to generate separate exit orders for each entry with that ID. When the market price reaches the takeProfit or stopLoss value, the broker emulator fills two exit orders and closes the position: A single strategy.exit() call can also generate exit orders for all entries in an open position, irrespective of entry ID, when it does not include a from_entry argument. Here, we changed the strategy.entry() instance in the above script to create an entry order with a distinct ID on each call, and we removed the from_entry argument from the strategy.exit() call. Since this version does not specify which entries the exit orders apply to, the strategy.exit() call creates orders for every entry in the position: It’s crucial to note that a call to strategy.exit() without a from_entry argument persists and creates exit orders for all open trades in a position, regardless of when the entries occur. This behavior can affect strategies that manage positions with multiple entries or exits. When a strategy has an open position and calls strategy.exit() on any bar without specifying a from_entry ID, it generates exit orders for each entry created before or on that bar, and it continues to generate exit orders for subsequent entries after that bar until the position closes. Let’s explore this behavior and how it works. The script below creates a long entry order with strategy.entry() on each bar within a user-specified time range, and it calls strategy.exit() without a from_entry argument on one bar within that range to generate exit orders for every entry in the open position. The exit command uses a loss value of 0, which means an exit order fills each time the market price is not above an entry order’s price. The script prompts users to select three points before it starts its calculations. The first point specifies when order creation begins, the second determines when the single strategy.exit() call occurs, and the third specifies when order creation stops: Note that: We included pyramiding = 100 in the strategy() declaration statement, which allows the position to have up to 100 open entries from strategy.entry(). The script uses labels and bgcolor() to signify when order placement starts and stops and when the strategy.exit() call occurs. The script draws a line and a label at the lowest entry price to show the value the market price must reach to close the position. We can observe the unique strategy.exit() behavior in this example by comparing the code itself with the script’s chart outputs. The script calls strategy.exit() one time, only on the bar with the blue label. However, this single call placed exit orders for every entry before or on that bar and continued placing exit orders for all entries after that bar. This behavior occurs because strategy.exit() has no way to determine when to stop placing orders if it does not link to entries with a specific ID. In this case, the command only ceases to create new exit orders after the position fully closes. The above script would exhibit different behavior if we included a from_entry argument in the strategy.exit() call. When a call to this command specifies a from_entry ID, it only applies to entries with that ID which the strategy created before or on the bar of the call. The command does not place exit orders for subsequent entries created after that bar in that case, even ones with the same ID. Here, we added from_entry = "Entry" to our script’s strategy.exit() call, meaning it only produces exit orders for entries with the “Entry” ID. Only 17 exits occur this time, each corresponding to an entry order created before or on the bar with the blue label. The call does not affect any entries that the strategy creates after that bar: `strategy.close()` and `strategy.close_all()` The strategy.close() and strategy.close_all() commands generate orders to exit from an open position. Unlike strategy.exit(), which creates price-based exit orders (e.g., stop-loss), these commands generate market orders that the broker emulator fills on the next available tick, irrespective of the price. The example below demonstrates a simple strategy that places a “buy” entry order with strategy.entry() once every 50 bars and a market order to close the long position with strategy.close() 25 bars afterward:
As we can see in the example above, after applying a 1% commission to the backtest, the
strategy simulated a significantly reduced net profit of only 1.42% and a more volatile equity
curve with an elevated max drawdown. These results highlight the impact that commission
can have on a strategy’s hypothetical performance.
Slippage and unfilled limits
In real-life trading, a broker/exchange may fill orders at slightly different prices than a trader
intended, due to volatility, liquidity, order size, and other market factors, which can profoundly
impact a strategy’s performance. The disparity between expected prices and the actual
prices at which the broker/exchange executes trades is what we refer to as slippage. Slippage
is dynamic and unpredictable, making it impossible to simulate precisely. However, factoring
in a small amount of slippage on each trade during a backtest or forward test might help the
results better align with reality. Users can model slippage in their strategy results, sized as a
fixed number of ticks, by including a slippage argument in the strategy() declaration
statement or by setting the “Slippage” input in the “Settings/Properties” tab.
The following example demonstrates how simulating slippage affects the fill prices of market
orders in a strategy test. The script below places a “Buy” market order of 2% equity when the
market price is above a rising EMA and closes the position when the price dips below the EMA
while it’s falling. We’ve included slippage = 20 in the strategy() function, which declares
that the price of each simulated order will slip 20 ticks in the direction of the trade.
The script uses strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index() and
strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index() to get the entryIndex and exitIndex , which it uses
to obtain the fillPrice of the order. When the bar index is at the entryIndex , the
fillPrice is the first strategy.opentrades.entry_price() value. At the exitIndex , fillPrice
is the strategy.closedtrades.exit_price() value from the last closed trade. The script plots the
expected fill price along with the simulated fill price after slippage to visually compare the
difference:
Note that:
Since the strategy applies constant slippage to all order fills, some orders can fill outside
the candle range in the simulation. Exercise caution with this setting, as adding
excessive simulated slippage can produce unrealistically worse testing results.
Some traders might assume that they can avoid the adverse effects of slippage by using limit
orders, as unlike market orders, they cannot execute at a worse price than the specified value.
However, even if the market price reaches an order’s price, there’s a chance that a limit order
might not fill, depending on the state of the real-life market, because limit orders can only fill
if a security has sufficient liquidity and price action around their values. To account for the
possibility of unfilled orders in a backtest, users can specify the
backtest_fill_limits_assumption value in the declaration statement or use the “Verify price
for limit orders” input in the “Settings/Properties” tab. This setting instructs the strategy to fill
limit orders only after the market price moves a defined number of ticks past the order prices.
The following example places a limit order of 2% equity at a bar’s hlcc4 price when the high is
the highest value over the past length bars and there are no pending entries. The strategy
closes the market position and cancels all orders after the low is the lowest value. Each time
the strategy triggers an order, it draws a horizontal line at the limitPrice , which it updates
on each bar until closing the position or canceling the order:
By default, the script assumes that all limit orders are guaranteed to fill when the market price
reaches their values, which is often not the case in real-life trading. Let’s add price verification
to our limit orders to account for potentially unfilled ones. In this example, we’ve included
backtest_fill_limits_assumption = 3 in the strategy() function call. As we can see, using
limit verification omits some simulated order fills and changes the times of others, because
the entry orders can now only fill after the price exceeds the limit price by three ticks:
Risk management
Designing a strategy that performs well, especially in a broad class of markets, is a
challenging task. Most strategies are designed for specific market patterns/conditions and
can produce uncontrolled losses when applied to other data. Therefore, a strategy’s risk
management behavior can be critical to its performance. Programmers can set risk
management criteria in their strategy scripts using the strategy.risk.*() commands.
Strategies can incorporate any number of risk management criteria in any combination. All
risk management commands execute on every tick and order execution event, regardless of
any changes to the strategy’s calculation behavior. There is no way to deactivate any of these
commands on specific script executions. Irrespective of a risk management command’s
location, it always applies to the strategy unless the programmer removes the call from the
code.
strategy.risk.allow_entry_in()
This command overrides the market direction allowed for all strategy.entry() commands in
the script. When a user specifies the trade direction with the strategy.risk.allow_entry_in()
function (e.g., long) the strategy enters trades only in that direction. If a script calls an
entry command in the opposite direction while there’s an open market position, the
strategy simulates a market order to close the position.
strategy.risk.max_cons_loss_days()
This command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and stops all
additional trade actions after the strategy simulates a defined number of trading days with
consecutive losses.
strategy.risk.max_drawdown()
This command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and stops all
additional trade actions after the strategy’s drawdown reaches the amount specified in the
function call.
strategy.risk.max_intraday_filled_orders()
This command specifies the maximum number of filled orders per trading day (or per chart
bar if the timeframe is higher than daily). If the strategy creates more orders than the
maximum, the command cancels all pending orders, closes any open market position, and
halts trading activity until the end of the current session.
strategy.risk.max_intraday_loss()
This command controls the maximum loss the strategy tolerates per trading day (or per
chart bar if the timeframe is higher than daily). When the strategy’s losses reach this
threshold, it cancels all pending orders, closes the open market position, and stops all
trading activity until the end of the current session.
strategy.risk.max_position_size()
This command specifies the maximum possible position size when using strategy.entry()
commands. If the quantity of an entry command results in a market position that exceeds
this threshold, the strategy reduces the order quantity so that the resulting position does
not exceed the limit.
Margin
Margin is the minimum percentage of a market position that a trader must hold in their
account as collateral to receive and sustain a loan from their broker to achieve their desired
leverage. The margin_long and margin_short parameters of the strategy() declaration
statement and the “Margin for long/short positions” inputs in the “Properties” tab of the script
settings specify margin percentages for long and short positions. For example, if a trader sets
the margin for long positions to 25%, they must have enough funds to cover 25% of an open
long position. This margin percentage also means the trader can potentially spend up to
400% of their equity on their trades.
If a strategy’s simulated funds cannot cover the losses from a margin trade, the broker
emulator triggers a margin call, which forcibly liquidates all or part of the open position. The
exact number of contracts/shares/lots/units that the emulator liquidates is four times the
amount required to cover the loss, which helps prevent constant margin calls on subsequent
bars. The emulator determines liquidated quantity using the following algorithm:
1. Calculate the amount of capital spent on the position: Money Spent = Quantity * Entry
Price
2. Calculate the Market Value of Security (MVS): MVS = Position Size * Current Price
3. Calculate the Open Profit as the difference between MVS and Money Spent . If the
position is short, multiply this value by -1.
4. Calculate the strategy’s equity value: Equity = Initial Capital + Net Profit + Open
Profit
5. Calculate the margin ratio: Margin Ratio = Margin Percent / 100
6. Calculate the margin value, which is the cash required to cover the hypothetical
account’s portion of the position: Margin = MVS * Margin Ratio
7. Calculate the strategy’s available funds: Available Funds = Equity - Margin
8. Calculate the total amount of money lost: Loss = Available Funds / Margin Ratio
9. Calculate the number of contracts/shares/lots/units the account must liquidate to cover
the loss, truncated to the same decimal precision as the minimum position size for the
current symbol: Cover Amount = TRUNCATE(Loss / Current Price).
10. Multiply the quantity required to cover the loss by four to determine the margin call size:
Margin Call Size = Cover Amount * 4
To examine this calculation in detail, let’s add the built-in Supertrend Strategy to the
NASDAQ:TSLA chart on the “1D” timeframe and set the “Order size” to 300% of equity and
the “Margin for long positions” to 25% in the “Properties” tab of the strategy settings:
The first entry happened at the bar’s opening price on 16 Sep 2010. The strategy bought
682,438 shares (Position Size) at 4.43 USD (Entry Price). Then, on 23 Sep 2010, when the
price dipped to 3.9 (Current Price), the emulator forcibly liquidated 111,052 shares with a
margin call. The calculations below show how the broker emulator determined this amount for
the margin call event:
Note that:
The strategy.margin_liquidation_price variable’s value represents the price level that will
cause a margin call if the market price reaches it. For more information about how
margin works and the formula for calculating a position’s margin call price, see this page
in our Help Center.
Using strategy information in scripts
Numerous built-ins within the strategy.* namespace and its sub-namespaces provide
convenient solutions for programmers to use a strategy’s trade and performance information,
including data shown in the Strategy Tester, directly within their code’s logic and calculations.
Several strategy.* variables hold fundamental information about a strategy, including its
starting capital, equity, profits and losses, run-up and drawdown, and open position:
strategy.account_currency
strategy.initial_capital
strategy.equity
strategy.netprofit and strategy.netprofit_percent
strategy.grossprofit and strategy.grossprofit_percent
strategy.grossloss and strategy.grossloss_percent
strategy.openprofit and strategy.openprofit_percent
strategy.max_runup and strategy.max_runup_percent
strategy.max_drawdown and strategy.max_drawdown_percent
strategy.position_size
strategy.position_avg_price
strategy.position_entry_name
Additionally, the namespace features multiple variables that hold general trade information,
such as the number of open and closed trades, the number of winning and losing trades,
average trade profits, and maximum trade sizes:
strategy.opentrades
strategy.closedtrades
strategy.wintrades
strategy.losstrades
strategy.eventrades
strategy.avg_trade and strategy.avg_trade_percent
strategy.avg_winning_trade and strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent
strategy.avg_losing_trade and strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent
strategy.max_contracts_held_all
strategy.max_contracts_held_long
strategy.max_contracts_held_short
Programmers can use these variables to display relevant strategy information on their charts,
create customized trading logic based on strategy data, calculate custom performance
metrics, and more.
The following example demonstrates a few simple use cases for these strategy.* variables.
The script uses them in its order placement and display calculations. When the calculated
rank crosses above 10 and the strategy.opentrades value is 0, the script calls
strategy.entry() to place a “Buy” market order. On the following bar, where that order fills, it
calls strategy.exit() to create a stop-loss order at a user-specified percentage below the
strategy.position_avg_price. If the rank crosses above 80 during the open trade, the script
uses strategy.close() to exit the position on the next bar.
The script draws a table on the main chart pane displaying formatted strings containing the
strategy’s net profit and net profit percentage, the account currency, the number of winning
trades and the win percentage, the ratio of the average profit to the average loss, and the
profit factor (the ratio of the gross profit to the gross loss). It also plots the total equity in a
separate pane and highlights the pane’s background based on the strategy’s open profit:
Note that:
This script creates a stop-loss order one bar after the entry order because it uses
strategy.position_avg_price to determine the price level. This variable has a non-na
value only when the strategy has an open position.
The script only draws the table on the last historical bar and all realtime bars because
the historical states of tables are never visible. See the Reducing drawing updates
section of the Profiling and optimization page for more information.
We included force_overlay = true in the table.new() call to display the table on the
main chart pane.
Individual trade information
The strategy.* namespace features two sub-namespaces that provide access to individual
trade information: strategy.opentrades.* and strategy.closedtrades.* . The
strategy.opentrades.* built-ins return data for incomplete (open) trades, and the
strategy.closedtrades.* built-ins return data for completed (closed) trades. With these
built-ins, programmers can use granular trade data in their scripts, allowing for more detailed
strategy analysis and advanced calculations.
Both sub-namespaces contain several similar functions that return information about a trade’s
orders, simulated costs, and profit/loss, including:
strategy.opentrades.entry_id() / strategy.closedtrades.entry_id()
strategy.opentrades.entry_price() / strategy.closedtrades.entry_price()
strategy.opentrades.entry_bar_index() / strategy.closedtrades.entry_bar_index()
strategy.opentrades.entry_time() / strategy.closedtrades.entry_time()
strategy.opentrades.entry_comment() / strategy.closedtrades.entry_comment()
strategy.opentrades.size() / strategy.closedtrades.size()
strategy.opentrades.profit() / strategy.closedtrades.profit()
strategy.opentrades.profit_percent() / strategy.closedtrades.profit_percent()
strategy.opentrades.commission() / strategy.closedtrades.commission()
strategy.opentrades.max_runup() / strategy.closedtrades.max_runup()
strategy.opentrades.max_runup_percent() / strategy.closedtrades.max_runup_percent()
strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown() / strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown()
strategy.opentrades.max_drawdown_percent() /
strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown_percent()
strategy.closedtrades.exit_id()
strategy.closedtrades.exit_price()
strategy.closedtrades.exit_time()
strategy.closedtrades.exit_bar_index()
strategy.closedtrades.exit_comment()
Note that:
Most built-ins within these namespaces are functions. However, the
strategy.opentrades.* namespace also features a unique variable:
strategy.opentrades.capital_held. Its value represents the amount of capital reserved by
all open trades.
Only the strategy.closedtrades.* namespace has .exit_*() functions that return
information about exit orders.
All strategy.opentrades.*() and strategy.closedtrades.*() functions have a trade_num
parameter, which accepts an “int” value representing the index of the open or closed trade.
The index of the first open/closed trade is 0, and the last trade’s index is one less than the
value of the strategy.opentrades/strategy.closedtrades variable.
The following example places up to five long entry orders per position, each with a unique ID,
and it calculates metrics for specific closed trades.
The strategy places a new entry order when the close crosses above its median without
reaching the highest value, but only if the number of open trades is less than five. It exits
each position using stop-loss orders from strategy.exit() or a market order from
strategy.close_all(). Each successive entry order’s ID depends on the number of open trades.
The first entry ID in each position is “Buy0”, and the last possible entry ID is “Buy4”.
The script calls strategy.closedtrades.*() functions within a for loop to access closed
trade entry IDs, profits, entry bar indices, and exit bar indices. It uses this information to
calculate the total number of closed trades with the specified entry ID, the number of winning
trades, the average number of bars per trade, and the total profit from all the trades. The
script then organizes this information in a formatted string and displays it in a single-cell
table:
Note that:
This strategy can open up to five long trades per position because we included
pyramiding = 5 in the strategy() declaration statement. See the pyramiding section for
more information.
The strategy.exit() instance in this script persists and generates exit orders for every
entry in the open position because we did not specify a from_entry ID. See the Exits for
multiple entries section to learn more about this behavior.
Strategy alerts
Pine Script™ indicators (not strategies) have two different mechanisms to set up custom alert
conditions: the alertcondition() function, which tracks one specific condition per function call,
and the alert() function, which tracks all its calls simultaneously, but provides greater flexibility
in the number of calls, alert messages, etc.
Pine Script™ strategies cannot create alert triggers using the alertcondition() function, but
they can create triggers with the alert() function. Additionally, each order placement
command comes with its own built-in alert functionality that does not require any additional
code to implement. As such, any strategy that uses an order placement command can issue
alerts upon order execution. The precise mechanics of such built-in strategy alerts are
described in the Order Fill events section of the Alerts page.
When a strategy uses both the alert() function and functions that create orders in the same
script, the “Create Alert” dialog box provides a choice between the conditions to use as a
trigger: alert() events, order fill events, or both.
For many trading strategies, the delay between a triggered alert and a live trade can be a
critical performance factor. By default, strategy scripts can only execute alert() function calls
on the close of realtime bars, as if they used alert.freq_once_per_bar_close, regardless of the
freq argument in the call. Users can change the alert frequency by including
calc_on_every_tick = true in the strategy() call or selecting the “Recalculate/On every tick”
option in the “Settings/Properties” tab before creating the alert. However, depending on the
script, this setting can adversely impact the strategy’s behavior. See the `calc_on_every_tick`
section for more information.
Order fill alert triggers do not suffer the same limitations as the triggers from alert() calls,
which makes them more suitable for sending alerts to third parties for automation. Alerts from
order fill events execute immediately, unaffected by a script’s calc_on_every_tick setting.
Users can set the default message for order fill alerts via the //@strategy_alert_message
compiler annotation. The text provided with this annotation populates the “Message” field in
the “Create Alert” dialog box.
The following script shows a simple example of a default order fill alert message. Above the
strategy() declaration statement, the script includes @strategy_alert_message with
placeholders for the trade action, current position size, ticker name, and fill price values in the
message text:
This script populates the “Create Alert” dialog box with its default message when the user
selects its name from the “Condition” dropdown tab:
When the alert fires, the strategy populates the placeholders in the alert message with their
corresponding values. For example:
Notes on testing strategies
Testing and tuning strategies in historical and live market conditions can provide insight into a
strategy’s characteristics, potential weaknesses, and possibly its future potential. However,
traders should always be aware of the biases and limitations of simulated strategy results,
especially when using the results to support live trading decisions. This section outlines some
caveats associated with strategy validation and tuning and possible solutions to mitigate their
effects.
Backtesting and forward testing
Backtesting is a technique to evaluate the historical performance of a trading strategy or
model by simulating and analyzing its past results on historical market data. This technique
assumes that a strategy’s results on past data can provide insight into its strengths and
weaknesses. When backtesting, many traders adjust the parameters of a strategy in an
attempt to optimize its results. Analysis and optimization of historical results can help traders
to gain a deeper understanding of a strategy. However, traders should always understand the
risks and limitations when basing their decisions on optimized backtest results.
It is prudent to also use realtime analysis as a tool for evaluating a trading system on a
forward-looking basis. Forward testing aims to gauge the performance of a strategy in live
market conditions, where factors such as trading costs, slippage, and liquidity can
meaningfully affect its performance. While forward testing has the distinct advantage of not
being affected by certain types of biases (e.g., lookahead bias or “future data leakage”), it
does carry the disadvantage of being limited in the quantity of data to test. Therefore,
although it can provide helpful insights into a strategy’s performance in current market
conditions, forward testing is not typically used on its own.
Lookahead bias
One typical issue in backtesting strategies that request alternate timeframe data, use
repainting variables such as timenow, or alter calculation behavior for intrabar order fills, is the
leakage of future data into the past during evaluation, which is known as lookahead bias. Not
only is this bias a common cause of unrealistic strategy results, since the future is never
actually knowable beforehand, but it is also one of the typical causes of strategy repainting.
Traders can often confirm whether a strategy has lookahead bias by forward testing it on
realtime data, where no known data exists beyond the latest bar. Since there is no future data
to leak into the past on realtime bars, the strategy will behave differently on historical and
realtime bars if its results have lookahead bias.
To eliminate lookahead bias in a strategy:
Do not use repainting variables that leak future values into the past in the order
placement or cancellation logic.
Do not include barmerge.lookahead_on in request.*() calls without offsetting the data
series, as described in this section of the Repainting page.
Use realistic strategy calculation behavior.
Selection bias
Selection bias occurs when a trader analyzes only results on specific instruments or
timeframes while ignoring others. This bias can distort the perspective of the strategy’s
robustness, which can impact trading decisions and performance optimizations. Traders can
reduce the effects of selection bias by evaluating their strategies on multiple, ideally diverse,
symbols and timeframes, and ensuring not to ignore poor performance results or “cherrypick”
testing ranges.
Overfitting
A common problem when optimizing a strategy based on backtest results is overfitting
(“curve fitting”), which means tailoring the strategy for specific data. An overfitted strategy
often fails to generalize well on new, unseen data. One widely-used approach to help reduce
the potential for overfitting and promote better generalization is to split an instrument’s data
into two or more parts to test the strategy outside the sample used for optimization,
otherwise known as “in-sample” (IS) and “out-of-sample” (OOS) backtesting.
In this approach, traders optimize strategy parameters on the IS data, and they test the
optimized configuration on the OOS data without additional fine-tuning. Although this and
other, more robust approaches might provide a glimpse into how a strategy might fare after
optimization, traders should still exercise caution. No trading strategy can guarantee future
performance, regardless of the data used for optimization and testing, because the future is
inherently unknowable.

The performance results from a strategy applied to non-standard charts (Heikin Ashi, Renko, Line Break, Kagi, Point & Figure, and Range) do not reflect actual market conditions by default. The strategy uses the chart’s synthetic prices in its simulation, which do not typically represent real-world market prices, leading to unrealistic strategy results. Therefore, we strongly recommend using standard chart types when testing strategies. Alternatively, on Heikin Ashi charts, users can simulate order fills using actual prices by enabling the “Fill orders on standard OHLC” option in the strategy’s properties or including fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc = true in the strategy() declaration statement.

In contrast, calling strategy.exit() with both arguments creates two exit orders: a take-profit order at the limit price and a stop-loss order at the stop price.

Notice! Limit verification can change the times of some order fills. However,
strategies still execute verified limit orders at the same prices. This “time-warping”
effect is a compromise that preserves the prices of limit orders, but it can cause a
strategy to fill the orders at times that wouldn’t necessarily be possible in the real
world. Therefore, users should exercise caution with this setting and understand its
limitations when analyzing strategy results.

Notice! Although testing strategies on existing data might give traders helpful
information about a strategy’s qualities, it’s important to note that neither the past nor
the present guarantees the future. Financial markets can change rapidly and
unpredictably, which can cause a strategy to sustain uncontrollable losses.
Additionally, simulated results may not fully account for other real-world factors that
can impact trading performance. Therefore, we recommend that traders thoroughly
understand the limitations and risks of backtests and forward tests and consider them
“parts of the whole” in their validation processes rather than basing decisions solely
on the results.
User Manual / Concepts / Tables
Tables
Introduction
Tables are objects that can be used to position information in specific and fixed locations in a
script’s visual space. Contrary to all other plots or objects drawn in Pine Script™, tables are
not anchored to specific bars; they float in a script’s space, whether in overlay or pane mode,
in studies or strategies, independently of the chart bars being viewed or the zoom factor
used.
Tables contain cells arranged in columns and rows, much like a spreadsheet. They are created
and populated in two distincts steps:
1. A table’s structure and key attributes are defined using table.new(), which returns a
table ID that acts like a pointer to the table, just like label, line, or array IDs do. The
table.new() call will create the table object but does not display it.
2. Once created, and for it to display, the table must be populated using one table.cell()
call for each cell. Table cells can contain text, or not. This second step is when the width
and height of cells are defined.
Most attributes of a previously created table can be changed using table.set_*() setter
functions. Attributes of previously populated cells can be modified using table.cell_set_*()
functions.
A table is positioned in an indicator’s space by anchoring it to one of nine references: the four
corners or midpoints, including the center. Tables are positioned by expanding the table from
its anchor, so a table anchored to the position.middle_right reference will be drawn by
expanding up, down and left from that anchor.
Two modes are available to determine the width/height of table cells:
A default automatic mode calculates the width/height of cells in a column/row using the
widest/highest text in them.
An explicit mode allows programmers to define the width/height of cells using a
percentage of the indicator’s available x/y space.
Displayed table contents always represent the last state of the table, as it was drawn on the
script’s last execution, on the dataset’s last bar. Contrary to values displayed in the Data
Window or in indicator values, variable contents displayed in tables will thus not change as a
script user moves his cursor over specific chart bars. For this reason, it is strongly
recommended to always restrict execution of all table.*() calls to either the first or last bars
of the dataset. Accordingly:
Use the var keyword to declare tables.
Enclose all other calls inside an if barstate.islast block.
Multiple tables can be used in one script, as long as they are each anchored to a
different position. Each table object is identified by its own ID. Limits on the quantity of
cells in all tables are determined by the total number of cells used in one script.
Creating tables
When creating a table using table.new(), three parameters are mandatory: the table’s position
and its number of columns and rows. Five other parameters are optional: the table’s
background color, the color and width of the table’s outer frame, and the color and width of
the borders around all cells, excluding the outer frame. All table attributes except its number
of columns and rows can be modified using setter functions: table.set_position(),
table.set_bgcolor(), table.set_frame_color(), table.set_frame_width(),
table.set_border_color() and table.set_border_width().
Tables can be deleted using table.delete(), and their content can be selectively removed using
table.clear().
When populating cells using table.cell(), you must supply an argument for four mandatory
parameters: the table id the cell belongs to, its column and row index using indices that start
at zero, and the text string the cell contains, which can be null. Seven other parameters are
optional: the width and height of the cell, the text’s attributes (color, horizontal and vertical
alignment, size), and the cell’s background color. All cell attributes can be modified using
setter functions: table.cell_set_text(), table.cell_set_width(), table.cell_set_height(),
table.cell_set_text_color(), table.cell_set_text_halign(), table.cell_set_text_valign(),
table.cell_set_text_size() and table.cell_set_bgcolor().
Keep in mind that each successive call to table.cell() redefines all the cell’s properties,
deleting any properties set by previous table.cell() calls on the same cell.
Placing a single value in a fixed position
Let’s create our first table, which will place the value of ATR in the upper-right corner of the
chart. We first create a one-cell table, then populate that cell:
Note that:
We use the var keyword when creating the table with table.new().
We populate the cell inside an if barstate.islast block using table.cell().
When populating the cell, we do not specify the width or height . The width and
height of our cell will thus adjust automatically to the text it contains.
We call ta.atr(14) prior to entry in our if block so that it evaluates on each bar. Had we
used str.tostring(ta.atr(14)) inside the if block, the function would not have
evaluated correctly because it would be called on the dataset’s last bar without having
calculated the necessary values from the previous bars.
Let’s improve the usability and aesthethics of our script:
Note that:
We used table.new() to define a background color, a frame color and its width.
When populating the cell with table.cell(), we set the text to display in white.
We pass format.mintick as a second argument to the str.tostring() function to restrict
the precision of ATR to the chart’s tick precision.
We now use an input to allow the script user to specify the period of ATR. The input also
includes a tooltip, which the user can see when he hovers over the “i” icon in the script’s
“Settings/Inputs” tab.
Coloring the chart’s background
This example uses a one-cell table to color the chart’s background on the bull/bear state of
RSI:
Note that:
We provide users with inputs allowing them to specify the bull/bear colors to use for the
background, and send those input colors as arguments to our colorChartBg() function.
We create a new table only once, using the var keyword to declare the table.
We use table.cell() on the last bar only, to specify the cell’s properties. We make the cell
the width and height of the indicator’s space, so it covers the whole chart.
Creating a display panel
Tables are ideal to create sophisticated display panels. Not only do they make it possible for
display panels to always be visible in a constant position, they provide more flexible
formatting because each cell’s properties are controlled separately: background, text color,
size and alignment, etc.
Here, we create a basic display panel showing a user-selected quantity of MAs values. We
display their period in the first column, then their value with a green/red/gray background that
varies with price’s position with regards to each MA. When price is above/below the MA, the
cell’s background is colored with the bull/bear color. When the MA falls between the current
bar’s open and close, the cell’s background is of the neutral color:
Note that:
Users can select the table’s position from the inputs, as well as the bull/bear/neutral
colors to be used for the background of the right column’s cells.
The table’s quantity of rows is determined using the number of MAs the user chooses to
display. We add one row for the column headers.
Even though we populate the table cells on the last bar only, we need to execute the
calls to ta.sma() on every bar so they produce the correct results. The compiler warning
that appears when you compile the code can be safely ignored.
We separate our inputs in two sections using group , and join the relevant ones on the
same line using inline . We supply tooltips to document the limits of certain fields
using tooltip .
Displaying a heatmap
Our next project is a heatmap, which will indicate the bull/bear relationship of the current
price relative to its past values. To do so, we will use a table positioned at the bottom of the
chart. We will display colors only, so our table will contain no text; we will simply color the
background of its cells to produce our heatmap. The heatmap uses a user-selectable
lookback period. It loops across that period to determine if price is above/below each bar in
that past, and displays a progressively lighter intensity of the bull/bear color as we go further
in the past:
Note that:
We define a maximum lookback period as a MAX_LOOKBACK constant. This is an
important value and we use it for two purposes: to specify the number of columns we
will create in our one-row table, and to specify the lookback period required for the
_src argument in our function, so that we force Pine Script™ to create a historical
buffer size that will allow us to refer to the required quantity of past values of _src in
our for loop.
We offer users the possibility of configuring the bull/bear colors in the inputs and we use
inline to place the color selections on the same line.
Inside our function, we enclose our table-creation code in an if barstate.islast construct
so that it only runs on the last bar of the chart.
The initialization of the table is done inside the if statement. Because of that, and the
fact that it uses the var keyword, initialization only occurs the first time the script
executes on a last bar. Note that this behavior is different from the usual var declarations
in the script’s global scope, where initialization occurs on the first bar of the dataset, at
bar_index zero.
We do not specify an argument to the text parameter in our table.cell() calls, so an
empty string is used.
We calculate our transparency in such a way that the intensity of the colors decreases
as we go further in history.
We use dynamic color generation to create different transparencies of our base colors
as needed.
Contrary to other objects displayed in Pine scripts, this heatmap’s cells are not linked to
chart bars. The configured lookback period determines how many table cells the
heatmap contains, and the heatmap will not change as the chart is panned horizontally,
or scaled.
The maximum number of cells that can be displayed in the scritp’s visual space will
depend on your viewing device’s resolution and the portion of the display used by your
chart. Higher resolution screens and wider windows will allow more table cells to be
displayed.
Tips
When creating tables in strategy scripts, keep in mind that unless the strategy uses
calc_on_every_tick = true , table code enclosed in if barstate.islast blocks will not
execute on each realtime update, so the table will not display as you expect.
Keep in mind that successive calls to table.cell() overwrite the cell’s properties specified
by previous table.cell() calls. Use the setter functions to modify a cell’s properties.
Remember to control the execution of your table code wisely by restricting it to the
necessary bars only. This saves server resources and your charts will display faster, so
everybody wins.

User Manual / Concepts / Text and shapes
Text and shapes
Introduction
You may display text or shapes using five different ways with Pine Script™:
plotchar()
plotshape()
plotarrow()
Labels created with label.new()
Tables created with table.new() (see Tables)
Which one to use depends on your needs:
Tables can display text in various relative positions on charts that will not move as users
scroll of zoom the chart horizontally. Their content is not tethered to bars. In contrast,
text displayed with plotchar(), plotshape() or label.new() is always tethered to a specific
bar, so it will move with the bar’s position on the chart. See the page on Tables for more
information on them.
Three function include are able to display pre-defined shapes: plotshape(), plotarrow()
and Labels created with label.new().
plotarrow() cannot display text, only up or down arrows.
plotchar() and plotshape() can display non-dynamic text on any bar or all bars of the
chart.
plotchar() can only display one character while plotshape() can display strings, including
line breaks.
label.new() can display a maximum of 500 labels on the chart. Its text can contain
dynamic text, or “series strings”. Line breaks are also supported in label text.
While plotchar() and plotshape() can display text at a fixed offset in the past or the
future, which cannot change during the script’s execution, each label.new() call can use
a “series” offset that can be calculated on the fly.
These are a few things to keep in mind concerning Pine Script™ strings:
Since the text parameter in both plotchar() and plotshape() require a “const string”
argument, it cannot contain values such as prices that can only be known on the bar
(“series string”).
To include “series” values in text displayed using label.new(), they will first need to be
converted to strings using str.tostring().
The concatenation operator for strings in Pine is + . It is used to join string components
into one string, e.g., msg = "Chart symbol: " + syminfo.tickerid (where
syminfo.tickerid is a built-in variable that returns the chart’s exchange and symbol
information in string format).
Characters displayed by all these functions can be Unicode characters, which may
include Unicode symbols. See this Exploring Unicode script to get an idea of what can
be done with Unicode characters.
The color or size of text can sometimes be controlled using function parameters, but no
inline formatting (bold, italics, monospace, etc.) is possible.
Text from Pine scripts always displays on the chart in the Trebuchet MS font, which is
used in many TradingView texts, including this one.
This script displays text using the four methods available in Pine Script™:
Note that:
The method used to display each text string is shown with the text, except for the lime
up arrows displayed using plotchar(), as it can only display one character.
Label and table calls can be inserted in conditional structures to control when their are
executed, whereas plotchar() and plotshape() cannot. Their conditional plotting must be
controlled using their first argument, which is a “series bool” whose true or false
value determines when the text is displayed.
Numeric values displayed in the table and labels is first converted to a string using
str.tostring().
We use the + operator to concatenate string components.
plotshape() is designed to display a shape with accompanying text. Its size parameter
controls the size of the shape, not of the text. We use na for its color argument so that
the shape is not visible.
Contrary to other texts, the table text will not move as you scroll or scale the chart.
Some text strings contain the 🠇 Unicode arrow (U+1F807).
Some text strings contain the \n sequence that represents a new line.
`plotchar()`
This function is useful to display a single character on bars. It has the following syntax:
See the Reference Manual entry for plotchar() for details on its parameters.
As explained in the When the script’s scale must be preserved section of our page on
Debugging, the function can be used to display and inspect values in the Data Window or in
the indicator values displayed to the right of the script’s name on the chart:
Note that:
The cursor is on the chart’s last bar.
The value of bar_index on that bar is displayed in indicator values (1) and in the Data
Window (2).
We use location.top because the default location.abovebar will put the price into play in
the script’s scale, which will often interfere with other plots.
plotchar() also works well to identify specific points on the chart or to validate that conditions
are true when we expect them to be. This example displays an up arrow under bars where
close, high and volume have all been rising for two bars:
Note that:
We use (na(volume) or ta.rising(volume, 2)) so our script will work on symbols
without volume data. If we did not make provisions for when there is no volume data,
which is what na(volume) does by being true when there is no volume, the
longSignal variable’s value would never be true because ta.rising(volume, 2)
yields false in those cases.
We display the arrow in gray when there is no volume, to remind us that all three base
conditions are not being met.
Because plotchar() is now displaying a character on the chart, we use size =
size.tiny to control its size.
We have adapted the location argument to display the character under bars.
If you don’t mind plotting only circles, you could also use plot() to achieve a similar effect:
This method has the inconvenience that, since there is no relative positioning mechanism with
plot() one must shift the circles down using something like ta.tr (the bar’s “True Range”):
`plotshape()`
This function is useful to display pre-defined shapes and/or text on bars. It has the following
syntax:
See the Reference Manual entry for plotshape() for details on its parameters.
Let’s use the function to achieve more or less the same result as with our second example of
the previous section:
Note that here, rather than using an arrow character, we are using the shape.arrowup
argument for the style parameter.
It is possible to use different plotshape() calls to superimpose text on bars. You will need to
use \n followed by a special non-printing character that doesn’t get stripped out to preserve
the newline’s functionality. Here we’re using a Unicode Zero-width space (U+200E). While
you don’t see it in the following code’s strings, it is there and can be copy/pasted. The special
Unicode character needs to be the last one in the string for text going up, and the first one
when you are plotting under the bar and text is going down:
The available shapes you can use with the style parameter are:
Argument Shape
With
Text
Argument Shape
With
Text
shape.xcross shape.arrowup
shape.cross shape.arrowdown
shape.circle shape.square
shape.triangleup shape.diamond
shape.triangledown shape.labelup
shape.flag shape.labeldown
`plotarrow()`
The plotarrow function displays up or down arrows of variable length, based on the relative
value of the series used in the function’s first argument. It has the following syntax:
See the Reference Manual entry for plotarrow() for details on its parameters.
The series parameter in plotarrow() is not a “series bool” as in plotchar() and plotshape(); it
is a “series int/float” and there’s more to it than a simple true or false value determining
when the arrows are plotted. This is the logic governing how the argument supplied to
series affects the behavior of plotarrow():
series > 0 : An up arrow is displayed, the length of which will be proportional to the
relative value of the series on that bar in relation to other series values.
series < 0 : A down arrow is displayed, proportionally-sized using the same rules.
series == 0 or na(series) : No arrow is displayed.
The maximum and minimum possible sizes for the arrows (in pixels) can be controlled using
the minheight and maxheight parameters.
Here is a simple script illustrating how plotarrow() works:
Note how the heigth of arrows is proportional to the relative size of the bar bodies.
You can use any series to plot the arrows. Here we use the value of the “Chaikin Oscillator” to
control the location and size of the arrows:
Note that we display the actual “Chaikin Oscillator” in a pane below the chart, so you can see
what values are used to determine the position and size of the arrows.
Labels
Labels are only available in v4 and higher versions of Pine Script™. They work very differently
than plotchar() and plotshape().
Labels are objects, like lines and boxes, or tables. Like them, they are referred to using an ID,
which acts like a pointer. Label IDs are of “label” type. As with other objects, labels IDs are
“time series” and all the functions used to manage them accept “series” arguments, which
makes them very flexible.
Labels are advantageous because:
They allow “series” values to be converted to text and placed on charts. This means
they are ideal to display values that cannot be known before time, such as price values,
support and resistance levels, of any other values that your script calculates.
Their positioning options are more flexible that those of the plot*() functions.
They offer more display modes.
Contrary to plot*() functions, label-handling functions can be inserted in conditional
or loop structures, making it easier to control their behavior.
You can add tooltips to labels.
One drawback to using labels versus plotchar() and plotshape() is that you can only draw a
limited quantity of them on the chart. The default is ~50, but you can use the
max_labels_count parameter in your indicator() or strategy() declaration statement to
specify up to 500. Labels, like lines and boxes, are managed using a garbage collection
mechanism which deletes the oldest ones on the chart, such that only the most recently
drawn labels are visible.
Your toolbox of built-ins to manage labels are all in the label namespace. They include:
label.new() to create labels.
label.set_*() functions to modify the properties of an existing label.
label.get_*() functions to read the properties of an existing label.
label.delete() to delete labels
The label.all array which always contains the IDs of all the visible labels on the chart. The
array’s size will depend on the maximum label count for your script and how many of
those you have drawn. aray.size(label.all) will return the array’s size.
Creating and modifying labels
The label.new() function creates a new label. It has the following signature:
The setter functions allowing you to change a label’s properties are:
label.set_x()
label.set_y()
label.set_xy()
label.set_text()
label.set_xloc()
label.set_yloc()
label.set_color()
label.set_style()
label.set_textcolor()
label.set_size()
label.set_textalign()
label.set_tooltip()
They all have a similar signature. The one for label.set_color() is:
where:
id is the ID of the label whose property is to be modified.
The next parameter is the property of the label to modify. It depends on the setter
function used. label.set_xy() changes two properties, so it has two such parameters.
This is how you can create labels in their simplest form:
Note that:
The label is created with the parameters x = bar_index (the index of the current bar,
bar_index) and y = high (the bar’s high value).
We do not supply an argument for the function’s text parameter. Its default value
being an empty string, no text is displayed.
No logic controls our label.new() call, so labels are created on every bar.
Only the last 54 labels are displayed because our indicator() call does not use the
max_labels_count parameter to specify a value other than the ~50 default.
Labels persist on bars until your script deletes them using label.delete(), or garbage
collection removes them.
In the next example we display a label on the bar with the highest high value in the last 50
bars:
Note that:
We create the label on the first bar only by using the var keyword to declare the lbl
variable that contains the label’s ID. The x , y and text arguments in that label.new()
call are irrelevant, as the label will be updated on further bars. We do, however, take care
to use the color and style we want for the labels, so they don’t need updating later.
On every bar, we detect if a new high was found by testing for changes in the value of
hi
When a change in the high value occurs, we update our label with new information. To
do this, we use three label.set*() calls to change the label’s relevant information. We
refer to our label using the lbl variable, which contains our label’s ID. The script is thus
maintaining the same label throughout all bars, but moving it and updating its
information when a new high is detected.
Here we create a label on each bar, but we set its properties conditionally, depending on the
bar’s polarity:
Positioning labels
Labels are positioned on the chart according to x (bars) and y (price) coordinates. Five
parameters affect this behavior: x , y , xloc , yloc and style :
x
Is either a bar index or a time value. When a bar index is used, the value can be offset in the
past or in the future (maximum of 500 bars in the future). Past or future offsets can also be
calculated when using time values. The x value of an existing label can be modified using
label.set_x() or label.set_xy().
xloc
Is either xloc.bar_index (the default) or xloc.bar_time. It determines which type of argument
must be used with x . With xloc.bar_index, x must be an absolute bar index. With
xloc.bar_time, x must be a UNIX time in milliseconds corresponding to the time value of a
bar’s open. The xloc value of an existing label can be modified using label.set_xloc().
y
Is the price level where the label is positioned. It is only taken into account with the default
yloc value of yloc.price . If yloc is yloc.abovebar or yloc.belowbar then the y argument
is ignored. The y value of an existing label can be modified using label.set_y() or
label.set_xy().
yloc
Can be yloc.price (the default), yloc.abovebar or yloc.belowbar. The argument used for y is
only taken into account with yloc.price. The yloc value of an existing label can be modified
using label.set_yloc().
style
The argument used has an impact on the visual appearance of the label and on its position
relative to the reference point determined by either the y value or the top/bottom of the bar
when yloc.abovebar or yloc.belowbar are used. The style of an existing label can be
modified using label.set_style().
These are the available style arguments:
Argument Label
Label
with
text
Argument Labe
label.style_xcross label.style_label_up
label.style_cross label.style_label_down
label.style_flag label.style_label_left
label.style_circle label.style_label_right
label.style_square label.style_label_lower_left
label.style_diamond label.style_label_lower_right
label.style_triangleup label.style_label_upper_left
label.style_triangledown label.style_label_upper_right
label.style_arrowup label.style_label_center
label.style_arrowdown label.style_none
When using xloc.bar_time, the x value must be a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. See the
page on Time for more information. The start time of the current bar can be obtained from the
time built-in variable. The bar time of previous bars is time[1] , time[2] and so on. Time
can also be set to an absolute value with the timestamp function. You may add or subtract
periods of time to achieve relative time offset.
Let’s position a label one day ago from the date on the last bar:
Note that because of varying time gaps and missing bars when markets are closed, the
positioning of the label may not always be exact. Time offsets of the sort tend to be more
reliable on 24x7 markets.
You can also offset using a bar index for the x value, e.g.:
Reading label properties
The following getter functions are available for labels:
label.get_x()
label.get_y()
label.get_text()
They all have a similar signature. The one for label.get_text() is:
where id is the label whose text is to be retrieved.
Cloning labels
The label.copy() function is used to clone labels. Its syntax is:
Deleting labels
The label.delete() function is used to delete labels. Its syntax is:
To keep only a user-defined quantity of labels on the chart, one could use code like this:
Note that:
We define a MAX_LABELS constant to hold the maximum quantity of labels a script can
accommodate. We use that value to set the max_labels_count parameter’s value in our
indicator() call, and also as the maxval value in our input.int() call to cap the user value.
We create a new label when our RSI breaches its highest value of the last 20 bars. Note
the offset of [1] we use in if myRSI > ta.highest(myRSI, 20)[1] . This is necessary.
Without it, the value returned by ta.highest() would always include the current value of
myRSI , so myRSI would never be higher than the function’s return value.
After that, we delete the oldest label in the label.all array that is automatically maintained
by the Pine Script™ runtime and contains the ID of all the visible labels drawn by our
script. We use the array.get() function to retrieve the array element at index zero (the
oldest visible label ID). We then use label.delete() to delete the label linked with that ID.
Note that if one wants to position a label on the last bar only, it is unnecessary and inefficent
to create and delete the label as the script executes on all bars, so that only the last label
remains:
This is the efficient way to realize the same task:
Realtime behavior
Labels are subject to both commit and rollback actions, which affect the behavior of a script
when it executes in the realtime bar. See the page on Pine Script™‘s Execution model.
This script demonstrates the effect of rollback when running in the realtime bar:
On realtime bars, label.new() creates a new label on every script update, but because of the
rollback process, the label created on the previous update on the same bar is deleted. Only
the last label created before the realtime bar’s close will be committed, and thus persist.

User Manual / Concepts / Time Time Introduction In Pine Script™, the following key aspects apply when working with date and time values: UNIX timestamp: The native format for time values in Pine, representing the absolute number of milliseconds elapsed since midnight UTC on 1970-01-01. Several built-ins return UNIX timestamps directly, which users can format into readable dates and times. See the UNIX timestamps section below for more information. Exchange time zone: The time zone of the instrument’s exchange. All calendar-based variables hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all built-in function overloads that have a timezone parameter use this time zone by default. Chart time zone: The time zone the chart and Pine Logs message prefixes use to express time values. Users can set the chart time zone using the “Timezone” input in the “Symbol” tab of the chart’s settings. This setting only changes the display of dates and times on the chart and the times that prefix logged messages. It does not affect the behavior of Pine scripts because they cannot access a chart’s time zone information. timezone parameter: A “string” parameter of time-related functions that specifies the time zone used in their calculations. For calendar-based functions, such as dayofweek(), the timezone parameter determines the time zone of the returned value. For functions that return UNIX timestamps, such as time(), the specified timezone defines the time zone of other applicable parameters, e.g., session . See the Time zone strings section to learn more. UNIX timestamps UNIX time is a standardized date and time representation that measures the number of non- leap seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC (the UNIX Epoch), typically expressed in seconds or smaller time units. A UNIX time value in Pine Script™ is an “int” timestamp representing the number of milliseconds from the UNIX Epoch to a specific point in time. Because a UNIX timestamp represents the number of consistent time units elapsed from a fixed historical point (epoch), its value is time zone-agnostic. A UNIX timestamp in Pine always corresponds to the same distinct point in time, accurate to the millisecond, regardless of a user’s location. For example, the UNIX timestamp 1723472500000 always represents the time 1,723,472,500,000 milliseconds (1,723,472,500 seconds) after the UNIX Epoch. This timestamp’s meaning does not change relative to any time zone. To format an “int” UNIX timestamp into a readable date/time “string” expressed in a specific time zone, use the str.format_time() function. The function does not modify UNIX timestamps. It simply represents timestamps in a desired human-readable format. For instance, the function can represent the UNIX timestamp 1723472500000 as a “string” in several ways, depending on its format and timezone arguments, without changing the absolute point in time that it refers to. The simple script below calculates three valid representations of this timestamp and displays them in the Pine Logs pane: Note that: The value enclosed within square brackets in the logged message is an automatic prefix representing the historical time of the log.info() call in ISO 8601 format, expressed in the chart time zone. See the Formatting dates and times section to learn more about representing UNIX timestamps with formatted strings. Time zones A time zone is a geographic region with an assigned local time. The specific time within a time zone is consistent throughout the region. Time zone boundaries typically relate to a location’s longitude. However, in practice, they tend to align with administrative boundaries rather than strictly following longitudinal lines. The local time within a time zone depends on its defined offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which can range from UTC-12:00 (12 hours behind UTC) to UTC+14:00 (14 hours ahead of UTC). Some regions maintain a consistent offset from UTC, and others have an offset that changes over time due to daylight saving time (DST) and other factors. Two primary time zones apply to data feeds and TradingView charts: the exchange time zone and the chart time zone. The exchange time zone represents the time zone of the current symbol’s exchange, which Pine scripts can access with the syminfo.timezone variable. Calendar-based variables, such as month, dayofweek, and hour, always hold values expressed in the exchange time zone, and all time function overloads that have a timezone parameter use this time zone by default. The chart time zone is a visual preference that defines how the chart and the time prefixes of Pine Logs represent time values. To set the chart time zone, use the “Timezone” input in the “Symbol” tab of the chart’s settings or click on the current time shown below the chart. The specified time zone does not affect time calculations in Pine scripts because they cannot access this chart information. Although scripts cannot access a chart’s time zone, programmers can provide inputs that users can adjust to match the time zone. For example, the script below uses str.format_time() to represent the UNIX timestamps of the last historical bar’s opening time and closing time as date-time strings, expressed in the function’s default time zone, the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user-specified time zone. It displays all four representations for comparison within a table in the bottom-right corner of the chart: Note that: The label on the chart signifies which bar’s times the displayed strings represent. The “Default” and “Exchange” rows in the table show identical results because syminfo.timezone is the str.format_time() function’s default timezone argument. The exchange time zone on our example chart appears as "America/New_York" , the IANA identifier for the NASDAQ exchange’s time zone. It represents UTC-4 or UTC-5, depending on the time of year. See the next section to learn more about time zone strings. Time zone strings All built-in functions with a timezone parameter accept a “string” argument specifying the time zone they use in their calculations. These functions can accept time zone strings in either of the following formats: UTC (or GMT) offset notation, e.g., "UTC-5" , "UTC+05:30" , "GMT+0100" IANA database notation, e.g., "America/New_York" , "Asia/Calcutta" , "Europe/Paris" The IANA time zone database reference page lists possible time zone identifiers and their respective UTC offsets. The listed identifiers are valid as timezone arguments. Note that various time zone strings expressed in UTC or IANA notation can represent the same offset from Coordinated Universal Time. For instance, these strings all represent a local time three hours ahead of UTC: "UTC+3" "GMT+03:00" "Asia/Kuwait" "Europe/Moscow" "Africa/Nairobi" For the str.format_time() function and the functions that calculate calendar-based values from a UNIX timestamp, including month(), dayofweek(), and hour(), the “string” passed to the timezone parameter changes the returned value’s calculation to express the result in the specified time zone. See the Formatting dates and times and Calendar-based functions sections for more information. The example below shows how time zone strings affect the returned values of calendar- based functions. This script uses three hour() function calls to calculate “int” values representing the opening hour of each bar in the exchange time zone, UTC-0, and a user- specified UTC offset. It plots all three calculated hours in a separate pane for comparison: Note that: The exchangeHour value is four or five hours behind the utcHour because the NASDAQ exchange is in the “America/New_York” time zone. This time zone has a UTC offset that changes during the year due to daylight saving time (DST). The script’s default customOffsetHour is consistently four hours ahead of the utcHour because its time zone is UTC+4. The call to the hour() function without a specified timezone argument returns the same value that the hour variable holds because both represent the bar’s opening hour in the exchange time zone (syminfo.timezone). For functions that return UNIX timestamps directly, such as time() and timestamp(), the timezone parameter defines the time zone of the function’s calendar-based parameters, including session , year , month , day , hour , minute , and second . The parameter does not determine the time zone of the returned value, as UNIX timestamps are time zone- agnostic. See the Testing for sessions and `timestamp()` sections to learn more. The following script calls the timestamp() function to calculate the UNIX timestamp of a specific date and time, and it draws a label at the timestamp’s corresponding bar location. The user-selected timezone argument ( timezoneInput ) determines the time zone of the call’s calendar-based arguments. Consequently, the calculated timestamp varies with the timezoneInput value because identical local times in various time zones correspond to different amounts of time elapsed since the UNIX Epoch: Note that: "Etc/UTC" is the IANA identifier for the UTC+0 time zone. The label.new() call uses xloc.bar_time as its xloc argument, which is required to anchor the drawing to an absolute time value. Without this argument, the function treats the unixTimestamp as a relative bar index, leading to an incorrect location. The label’s y value is the close of the bar where the opening time crosses the unixTimestamp . If the timestamp represents a future time, the label uses the last historical bar’s price. Although time zone strings can use either UTC or IANA notation, we recommend using IANA notation for timezone arguments in most cases, especially if a script’s time calculations must align with the observed time offset in a specific country or subdivision. When a time function call uses an IANA time zone identifier for its timezone argument, its calculations adjust automatically for historical and future changes to the specified region’s observed time, such as daylight saving time (DST) and updates to time zone boundaries, instead of using a fixed offset from UTC. The following script demonstrates how UTC and IANA time zone strings can affect time calculations differently. It uses two calls to the hour() function to calculate the hour from the current bar’s opening timestamp using "UTC-4" and "America/New_York" as timezone arguments. The script plots the results of both calls for comparison and colors the main pane’s background when the returned values do not match. Although these two hour() calls may seem similar because UTC-4 is an observed UTC offset in New York, they do not always return the same results, as shown below: The plots in the chart above diverge periodically because New York observes daylight saving time, meaning its UTC offset changes at specific points in a year. During DST, New York’s local time follows UTC-4. Otherwise, it follows UTC-5. Because the script’s first hour() call uses "UTC-4" as its timezone argument, it returns the correct hour in New York only during DST. In contrast, the call that uses the "America/New_York" time zone string adjusts its UTC offset automatically to return the correct hour in New York at any time of the year. Time variables Pine Script™ has several built-in variables that provide scripts access to different forms of time information: The time and time_close variables hold UNIX timestamps representing the current bar’s opening and closing times, respectively. The time_tradingday variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the starting time of the last UTC calendar day in a session. The timenow variable holds a UNIX timestamp representing the current time when the script executes. The year, month, weekofyear, dayofmonth, dayofweek, hour, minute, and second variables reference calendar values based on the current bar’s opening time, expressed in the exchange time zone.
hours because the bars open at 09:30 in exchange time, and 15 hours ahead is 00:30 on
the next calendar day.
It’s important to understand that although the time argument in a calendar-based function
call represents a single, absolute point in time, each function returns only part of the date and
time information available from the timestamp. Consequently, a calendar-based function’s
returned value does not directly correspond to a unique time point, and conditions based on
individual calendar values can apply to multiple bars.
For example, this script uses the timestamp() function to calculate a UNIX timestamp from a
date “string”, and it calculates the calendar day from that timestamp, in the exchange time
zone, with the dayofmonth() function. The script compares each bar’s opening day to the
calculated day and highlights the background when the two are equal:
Note that:
The timestamp() call treats its argument as a UTC calendar date because its
dateString argument does not specify time zone information. However, the
dayofmonth() call calculates the day in the exchange time zone. Our example symbol’s
exchange time zone is “America/New_York” (UTC-4/-5). Therefore, the returned value
on this chart is 28 instead of 29.
The script highlights any bar on our chart that opens on the 28th day of any month
instead of only a specific bar because the dayofmonth() function’s returned value does
not represent a specific point in time on its own.
This script highlights the bars that open on the day of the month calculated from the
timestamp. However, some months on our chart have no trading activity on that day. For
example, the script does not highlight when the July 28, 2024 occurs on our chart
because NASDAQ is closed on Sundays.
Similar to calendar-based variables, these functions are also helpful when testing for
dates/times and detecting calendar changes on the chart. The example below uses the year(),
month(), weekofyear(), and dayofweek() functions on the time_close timestamp to create
conditions that test if the current bar is the first bar that closes in a new year, quarter, month,
week, and day. The script uses plotted shapes, labels, and background colors to visualize the
conditions on the chart:
Note that:
This script’s conditions check for the first bar that closes after each calendar unit
changes its value. The bar where each condition is true varies with the data available
on the chart. For example, the closeInNewMonth condition can be true after the first
calendar day of the month if a chart bar did not close on that day.
To detect when new bars start on a specific timeframe rather than strictly calendar
changes, check when the ta.change() of a time() or time_close() call’s returned value is
nonzero, or use the timeframe.change() function. See this section above for more
information.
`timestamp()`
The timestamp() function calculates a UNIX timestamp from a specified calendar date and
time. It has the following three signatures:
The first two signatures listed include year , month , day , hour , minute , and second
parameters that accept “int” values defining the calendar date and time. A timestamp() call
with either signature must include year , month , and day arguments. The other parameters
are optional, each with a default value of 0. Both signatures can return either “simple” or
“series” values, depending on the qualified types of the specified arguments.
The primary difference between the first two signatures is the timezone parameter, which
accepts a time zone string that determines the time zone of the date and time specified by
the other parameters. If a timestamp() call with “int” calendar arguments does not include a
timezone argument, it uses the exchange time zone (syminfo.timezone) by default.
The third signature listed has only one parameter, dateString , which accepts a “string”
representing a valid calendar date (e.g., "20 Aug 2024" ). The value can also include the time
of day and time zone (e.g., "20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 UTC+0" ). If the dateString argument
does not specify the time of day, the timestamp() call considers the time 00:00 (midnight).
Unlike the other two signatures, the default time zone for the third signature is GMT+0. It
does not use the exchange time zone by default because it interprets time zone information
from the dateString directly. Additionally, the third signature is the only one that returns a
“const int” value. As shown in the Time input section of the Inputs page, programmers can
use this overload’s returned value as the defval argument in an input.time() function call.
When using the timestamp() function, it’s crucial to understand how time zone information
affects its calculations. The absolute point in time represented by a specific calendar date
depends on its time zone, as an identical date and time in various time zones can refer to
different amounts of time elapsed since the UNIX Epoch. Therefore, changing the time zone
of the calendar date and time in a timestamp() call can change its returned UNIX timestamp.
The following script compares the results of four different timestamp() calls that evaluate the
date 2021-01-01 in different time zones. The first timestamp() call does not specify time zone
information in its dateString argument, so it treats the value as a UTC calendar date. The
fourth call also evaluates the calendar date in UTC because it includes "UTC0" as the
timezone argument. The second timestamp() call uses the first signature listed above,
meaning it uses the exchange time zone, and the third call uses the second signature with
"America/New_York" as the timezone argument.
The script draws a table with rows displaying each timestamp() call, its assigned variable, the
calculated UNIX timestamp, and a formatted representation of the time. As we see on the
“NASDAQ:MSFT” chart below, the first and fourth table rows show different timestamps than
the first and third, leading to different formatted strings in the last column:
Note that:
The formatted date-time strings express results in the exchange time zone because the
str.format_time() function uses syminfo.timezone as the default timezone argument.
The formatted values on our example chart show the offset string "-0500" because
NASDAQ’s time zone (“America/New_York”) follows UTC-5 during standard time.
The formatted strings on the first and fourth rows show the date and time five hours
before January 1, 2021, because the timestamp() calls evaluated the date in UTC and
the str.format_time() calls used a time zone five hours behind UTC.
On our chart, the second and third rows have matching timestamps because both
corresponding timestamp() calls evaluated the date in the “America/New_York” time
zone. The two rows would show different results if we applied the script to a symbol with
a different exchange time zone.
Formatting dates and times
Programmers can format UNIX timestamps into human-readable dates and times, expressed
in specific time zones, using the str.format_time() function. The function has the following
signature:
Where:
The time parameter specifies the “int” UNIX timestamp to express as a readable time.
The format parameter accepts a “string” consisting of formatting tokens that
determine the returned information. If the function call does not include a format
argument, it uses the ISO 8601 standard format: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ" . See the
table below for a list of valid tokens and the information they represent.
The timezone parameter determines the time zone of the formatted result. It accepts a
time zone string in UTC or IANA notation. If the call does not specify a timezone , it uses
the exchange time zone (syminfo.timezone).
The general-purpose str.format() function can also format UNIX timestamps into readable
dates and times. However, the function cannot express time information in different time
zones. It always expresses dates and times in UTC+0. In turn, using this function to format
timestamps often results in erroneous practices, such as mathematically modifying a
timestamp to try and represent the time in another time zone. However, a UNIX timestamp is a
unique, time zone-agnostic representation of a specific point in time. As such, modifying a
UNIX timestamp changes the absolute time it represents rather than expressing the same
time in a different time zone.
The str.format_time() function does not have this limitation, as it can calculate dates and
times in any time zone correctly without changing the meaning of a UNIX timestamp. In
addition, unlike str.format(), it is optimized specifically for processing time values. Therefore,
we recommend that programmers use str.format_time() instead of str.format() to format UNIX
timestamps into readable dates and times.
A str.format_time() call’s format argument determines the time information its returned value
contains. The function treats characters and sequences in the argument as formatting tokens,
which act as placeholders for values in the returned date/time “string”. The following table
outlines valid formatting tokens and explains what each represents:

Separators
These characters are separators for formatting
tokens.
They appear as they are in the formatted text. (e.g.,
"01/01/24" , "12:30:00" , "Jan 1, 2024" ).
Some other characters can also act as separators.
However, the ones listed are the most common.
"'"
Escape
character
Characters enclosed within two single quotes appear
as they are in the result, even if they otherwise act as
formatting tokens. For example, " 'Day' " appears
as-is in the resulting “string” instead of listing the day
of the year, AM/PM postfix, and year.
The following example demonstrates how various formatting tokens affect the
str.format_time() function’s result. The script calls the function with different format
arguments to create date/time strings from time, timenow, and time_close timestamps. It
displays each format value and the corresponding formatted result in a table on the last bar:
Expressing time differences
Every UNIX timestamp represents a specific point in time as the absolute time difference from
a fixed historical point (epoch). The specific epoch all UNIX timestamps reference is midnight
UTC on January 1, 1970. Programmers can format UNIX timestamps into readable date-time
strings with the str.format_time() function because it uses the time difference from the UNIX
Epoch in its date and time calculations.
In contrast, the difference between two nonzero UNIX timestamps represents the number of
milliseconds elapsed from one absolute point to another. The difference does not directly
refer to a specific point in UNIX time if neither timestamp in the operation has a value of 0
(corresponding to the UNIX Epoch).
Programmers may want to express the millisecond difference between two UNIX timestamps
in other time units, such as seconds, days, etc. Some might assume they can use the
difference as the time argument in a str.format_time() call to achieve this result. However,
the function always treats its time argument as the time elapsed from the UNIX Epoch to
derive a calendar date/time representation in a specific time zone. It does not express time
differences directly. Therefore, attempting to format timestamp differences rather than
timestamps with str.format_time() leads to unintended results.
For example, the following script calculates the millisecond difference between the current
execution time (timenow) and the “1M” bar’s closing time (time_close(“1M”)) for a monthly
countdown timer display. It attempts to express the time difference in another format using
str.format_time(). It displays the function call’s result in a table, along with the original
millisecond difference ( timeLeft ) and formatted date-time representations of the
timestamps.
As we see below, the table shows correct results for the formatted timestamps and the
timeLeft value. However, the formatted time difference appears as "1970-01-12T16:47:10-
0500" . Although the timeLeft value is supposed to represent a difference between
timestamps rather than a specific point in time, the str.format_time() function still treats the
value as a UNIX timestamp. Consequently, it creates a “string” expressing the value as a
date and time in the UTC-5 time zone:
To express the difference between timestamps in other time units correctly, programmers
must write code that calculates the number of units elapsed instead of erroneously formatting
the difference as a specific date or time.
The calculations required to express time differences depend on the chosen time units. The
sections below explain how to express millisecond differences in weekly and smaller units,
and monthly and larger units.
Weekly and smaller units
Weeks and smaller time units (days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) cover
consistent blocks of time. These units have the following relationship:
One week equals seven days.
One day equals 24 hours.
One hour equals 60 minutes.
One minute equals 60 seconds.
One second equals 1000 milliseconds.
Using this relationship, programmers can define the span of these units by the number of
milliseconds they contain. For example, since every hour has 60 minutes, every minute has 60
seconds, and every second has 1000 milliseconds, the number of milliseconds per hour is 60
* 60 * 1000 , which equals 3600000 .
Programmers can use modular arithmetic based on the milliseconds in each unit to calculate
the total number of weeks, days, and smaller spans covered by the difference between two
UNIX timestamps. The process is as follows, starting from the largest time unit in the
calculation:
1. Calculate the number of milliseconds in the time unit.
2. Divide the remaining millisecond difference by the calculated value and round down to
the nearest whole number. The result represents the number of complete time units
within the interval.
3. Use the remainder from the division as the new remaining millisecond difference.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each time unit in the calculation, in descending order based on
size.
The following script implements this process in a custom formatTimeSpan() function. The
function accepts two UNIX timestamps defining a start and end point, and its “bool”
parameters control whether it calculates the number of weeks or smaller units covered by the
time range. The function calculates the millisecond distance between the two timestamps. It
then calculates the numbers of complete units covered by that distance and formats the
results into a “string”.
The script calls formatTimeSpan() to express the difference between two separate time input
values in selected time units. It then displays the resulting “string” in a table alongside
formatted representations of the start and end times:
Note that:
The user-defined function uses math.floor() to round each divided result down to the
nearest “int” value to get the number of complete units in the interval. After division, it
uses the modulo assignment operator (%=) to get the remainder and assign that value
to the timeDifference variable. This process repeats for each selected unit.
The image above shows the calculated time difference in mixed time units. By toggling the
“bool” inputs, users can also isolate specific units in the calculation. For example, this image
shows the result after enabling only the “Milliseconds” input:
Monthly and larger units
Unlike weeks and smaller units, months and larger units vary in length based on calendar
rules. For example, a month can contain 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and a year can contain 365 or
366 days.
Some programmers prefer to use the modular arithmetic outlined in the previous section, with
approximate lengths for these irregular units, to calculate large-unit durations between UNIX
timestamps. With this process, programmers usually define the units in either of the following
ways:
Using common lengths, e.g., a common year equals 365 days, and a common month
equals 30 days.
Using the average lengths, e.g., an average year equals 365.25 days, and an average
month equals 30.4375 days.
Calculations involving approximate units produce rough estimates of the elapsed time. Such
estimates are often practical when expressing relatively short durations. However, their
precision diminishes with the size of the difference, drifting further away from the actual time
elapsed.
Therefore, expressing time differences in monthly and larger units with precision requires a
different calculation than the process outlined above. For a more precise estimate of months,
years, and larger units elapsed, the calculations should use the actual span of each individual
unit rather than approximations, meaning it must account for leap years and variations in
month sizes.
The advanced example below contains a custom formatTimeDifference() function that
calculates the years and months, in addition to days and smaller units, elapsed between two
UNIX timestamps.
The function uses the process outlined in the previous section to calculate the daily and
smaller units within the interval. For the monthly and yearly units, which have irregular
lengths, the function uses a while loop to iterate across calendar months. On each iteration, it
increments monthly and yearly counters and subtracts the number of days in the added
month from the day counter. After the loop ends, the function adjusts the year, month, and
day counters to account for partial months elapsed between the timestamps. Finally, it uses
the counters in a str.format() call to create a formatted “string” containing the calculated
values.
The script calls this formatTimeDifference() function to calculate the years, months, days,
hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds elapsed between two separate time input values
and displays the result in a label:
Note that:
The script determines the number of days in each month with the user-defined
daysPerMonth() function. The function identifies whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31
days based on its month number and the year it belongs to. Its calculation accounts for
leap years. A leap year occurs when the year is divisible by 4 or 400 but not by 100.
Before the while loop, the function subtracts the number of days in a partial starting
month from the initial day count, aligning the counters with the beginning of a new
month. It re-adds the subtracted days after the loop to adjust the counters for partial
months. It adjusts the month and year counters based on the days in the startMonth if
the startDay is less than halfway through that month. Otherwise, it adjusts the values
based on the days in the endMonth .

Timeframes
Timeframes
Introduction
The
timeframe
of a chart is sometimes also referred to as its
interval
or
resolution
. It is theunit of time represented by one bar on the chart. All standard chart types use a timeframe:“Bars”, “Candles”, “Hollow Candles”, “Line”, “Area” and “Baseline”. One non-standard charttype also uses timeframes: “Heikin Ashi”.
Programmers interested in accessing data from multiple timeframes will need to becomefamiliar with how timeframes are expressed in Pine Script™, and how to use them.
Timeframe strings
come into play in different contexts:
They must be used in
request.security()
when requesting data from another symboland/or timeframe. See the page on
Other timeframes and data
to explore the use of
request.security()
.
They can be used as an argument to
time()
and
time_close()
functions, to return thetime of a higher timeframe bar. This, in turn, can be used to detect changes in highertimeframes from the chart’s timeframe without using
request.security()
. See the
Testingfor changes in higher timeframes
section to see how to do this.
The
input.timeframe()
function provides a way to allow script users to define atimeframe through a script’s “Inputs” tab (see the
Timeframe input
section for moreinformation).
The
indicator()
declaration statement has an optional
timeframe
parameter that can beused to provide multi-timeframe capabilities to simple scripts without using
request.security()
.
Many built-in variables provide information on the timeframe used by the chart the scriptis running on. See the
Chart timeframe
section for more information on them, including
timeframe.period
which returns a string in Pine Script™‘s timeframe specificationformat.
Timeframe string
specifications
Timeframe strings follow these rules:
They are composed of the multiplier and the timeframe unit, e.g., “1S”, “30” (30minutes), “1D” (one day), “3M” (three months).
The unit is represented by a single letter, with no letter used for minutes: “T” for ticks,“S” for seconds, “D” for days, “W” for weeks, and “M” for months.
When no multiplier is used, 1 is assumed: “S” is equivalent to “1S”, “D” to “1D”, etc. Ifonly “1” is used, it is interpreted as 1 minute, since no unit letter identifier is used forminutes.
There is no “hour” unit; “1H” is
not
valid. The correct format for one hour is “60”(remember no unit letter is specified for minutes).
The valid multipliers vary for each timeframe unit:
For ticks, only the discrete 1, 10, 100, and 1000 multipliers are valid.
For seconds, only the discrete 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 multipliers are valid.
For minutes, 1 to 1440.
For days, 1 to 365.
For weeks, 1 to 52.
For months, 1 to 12.
Comparing
timeframes
It can be useful to compare different timeframe strings to determine, for example, if thetimeframe used on the chart is lower than the higher timeframes used in the script.
Converting timeframe strings to a representation in fractional minutes provides a way tocompare them using a universal unit. This script uses the
timeframe.in_seconds()
function toconvert a timeframe into float seconds and then converts the result into minutes:
Note that:
We use the built-in
timeframe.in_seconds()
function to convert the chart and the
input.timeframe()
function into seconds, then divide by 60 to convert into minutes.
We use two calls to the
timeframe.in_seconds()
function in the initialization of the
chartTFInMinutes
and
inputTFInMinutes
variables. In the first instance, we do notsupply an argument for its
timeframe
parameter, so the function returns the chart’stimeframe in seconds. In the second call, we supply the timeframe selected by thescript’s user through the call to
input.timeframe()
.
Next, we validate the timeframes to ensure that the input timeframe is equal to or higherthan the chart’s timeframe. If it is not, we generate a runtime error.
We finally print the two timeframe values converted to minutes.

User Manual / Writing scripts / Style guide
Style guide
Introduction
This style guide provides recommendations on how to name variables and organize your Pine
scripts in a standard way that works well. Scripts that follow our best practices will be easier
to read, understand and maintain.
You can see scripts using these guidelines published from the TradingView and PineCoders
accounts on the platform.
Naming Conventions
We recommend the use of:
camelCase for all identifiers, i.e., variable or function names: ma , maFast ,
maLengthInput , maColor , roundedOHLC() , pivotHi() .
All caps SNAKE_CASE for constants: BULL_COLOR , BEAR_COLOR , MAX_LOOKBACK .
The use of qualifying suffixes when it provides valuable clues about the type or
provenance of a variable: maShowInput , bearColor , bearColorInput , volumesArray ,
maPlotID , resultsTable , levelsColorArray .
Script organization
The Pine Script™ compiler is quite forgiving of the positioning of specific statements or the
version compiler annotation in the script. While other arrangements are syntactically correct,
this is how we recommend organizing scripts:
<license>
If you publish your open-source scripts publicly on TradingView (scripts can also be
published privately), your open-source code is by default protected by the Mozilla license.
You may choose any other license you prefer.
The reuse of code from those scripts is governed by our House Rules on Script Publishing
which preempt the author’s license.
The standard license comments appearing at the beginning of scripts are:
<version>
This is the compiler annotation defining the version of Pine Script™ the script will use. If none
is present, v1 is used. For v6, use:
<declaration_statement>
This is the mandatory declaration statement which defines the type of your script. It must be
a call to either indicator(), strategy(), or library().
<import_statements>
If your script uses one or more Pine Script™ libraries, your import statements belong here.
<constant_declarations>
Scripts can declare variables qualified as “const”, i.e., ones referencing a constant value.
We refer to variables as “constants” when they meet these criteria:
Their declaration uses the optional const keyword (see our User Manual’s section on
type qualifiers for more information).
They are initialized using a literal (e.g., 100 or "AAPL" ) or a built-in qualified as “const”
(e.g., color.green ).
Their value does not change during the script’s execution.
We use SNAKE_CASE to name these variables and group their declaration near the top of the
script. For example:
In this example:
The RST* and LTF* constants will be used as tuple elements in the options
argument of input.*() calls.
The TT_* constants will be used as tooltip arguments in input.*() calls. Note how
we use a line continuation for long string literals.
We do not use var to initialize constants. The Pine Script™ runtime is optimized to
handle declarations on each bar, but using var to initialize a variable only the first time it
is declared incurs a minor penalty on script performance because of the maintenance
that var variables require on further bars.
Note that:
Literals used in more than one place in a script should always be declared as a constant.
Using the constant rather than the literal makes it more readable if it is given a
meaningful name, and the practice makes code easier to maintain. Even though the
quantity of milliseconds in a day is unlikely to change in the future, MS_IN_DAY is more
meaningful than 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 .
Constants only used in the local block of a function or if, while, etc., statement for
example, can be declared in that local block.
<inputs>
It is much easier to read scripts when all their inputs are in the same code section. Placing
that section at the beginning of the script also reflects how they are processed at runtime,
i.e., before the rest of the script is executed.
Suffixing input variable names with input makes them more readily identifiable when they
are used later in the script: maLengthInput , bearColorInput , showAvgInput , etc.
<function_declarations>
All user-defined functions must be defined in the script’s global scope; nested function
definitions are not allowed in Pine Script™.
Optimal function design should minimize the use of global variables in the function’s scope,
as they undermine function portability. When it can’t be avoided, those functions must follow
the global variable declarations in the code, which entails they can’t always be placed in the
<function_declarations> section. Such dependencies on global variables should ideally be
documented in the function’s comments.
It will also help readers if you document the function’s objective, parameters and result. The
same syntax used in libraries can be used to document your functions. This can make it easier
to port your functions to a library should you ever decide to do so:
<calculations>
This is where the script’s core calculations and logic should be placed. Code can be easier to
read when variable declarations are placed near the code segment using the variables. Some
programmers prefer to place all their non-constant variable declarations at the beginning of
this section, which is not always possible for all variables, as some may require some
calculations to have been executed before their declaration.
<strategy_calls>
Strategies are easier to read when strategy calls are grouped in the same section of the
script.
<visuals>
This section should ideally include all the statements producing the script’s visuals, whether
they be plots, drawings, background colors, candle-plotting, etc. See the Pine Script™ user
manual’s section on here for more information on how the relative depth of visuals is
determined.
<alerts>
Alert code will usually require the script’s calculations to have executed before it, so it makes
sense to put it at the end of the script.
Spacing
A space should be used on both sides of all operators, except unary operators ( -1 ). A space
is also recommended after all commas and when using named function arguments, as in
plot(series = close) :
Line wrapping
Line wrapping can make long lines easier to read. Line wraps are defined by using an
indentation level that is not a multiple of four, as four spaces or a tab are used to define local
blocks. Here we use two spaces:
Vertical alignment
Vertical alignment using tabs or spaces can be useful in code sections containing many
similar lines such as constant declarations or inputs. They can make mass edits much easier
using the Pine Editor’s multi-cursor feature ( ctrl + alt + 🠅 ):
Explicit typing
Including the type of variables when declaring them is not required. However, it helps make
scripts easier to read, navigate, and understand. It can help clarify the expected types at each
point in a script’s execution and distinguish a variable’s declaration (using = ) from its
reassignments (using := ). Using explicit typing can also make scripts easier to debug.

User Manual / Writing scripts / Debugging Debugging Introduction TradingView’s close integration between the Pine Editor and the chart interface facilitates efficient, interactive debugging of Pine Script™ code, as scripts can produce dynamic results in multiple locations, on and off the chart. Programmers can utilize such results to refine their script’s behaviors and ensure everything works as expected. When a programmer understands the appropriate techniques for inspecting the variety of behaviors one may encounter while writing a script, they can quickly and thoroughly identify and resolve potential problems in their code, which allows for a more seamless overall coding experience. This page demonstrates some of the handiest ways to debug code when working with Pine Script™. The lay of the land Pine scripts can output their results in multiple different ways, any of which programmers can utilize for debugging. The plot*() functions can display results in a chart pane, the script’s status line, the price (y-axis) scale, and the Data Window, providing simple, convenient ways to debug numeric and conditional values: Note that: A script’s status line outputs will only show when enabling the “Values” checkbox within the “Indicators” section of the chart’s “Status line” settings. Price scales will only show plot values or names when enabling the options from the “Indicators and financials” dropdown in the chart’s “Scales and lines” settings. The bgcolor() function displays colors in the script pane’s background, and the barcolor() function changes the colors of the main chart’s bars or candles. Both of these functions provide a simple way to visualize conditions: Pine’s drawing types (line, box, polyline, label) produce drawings in the script’s pane. While they don’t return results in other locations, such as the status line or Data Window, they provide alternative, flexible solutions for inspecting numeric values, conditions, and strings directly on the chart: The log.*() functions produce Pine Logs results. Every time a script calls any of these functions, the script logs a message in the Pine Logs pane, along with a timestamp and navigation options to identify the specific times, chart bars, and lines of code that triggered a log: One can apply any of the above, or a combination, to establish debugging routines to fit their needs and preferences, depending on the data types and structures they’re working with. See the sections below for detailed explanations of various debugging techniques. Numeric values When creating code in Pine Script™, working with numbers is inevitable. Therefore, to ensure a script works as intended, it’s crucial to understand how to inspect the numeric (int and float) values it receives and calculates. Plotting numbers One of the most straightforward ways to inspect a script’s numeric values is to use plot*() functions, which can display results graphically on the chart and show formatted numbers in the script’s status line, the price scale, and the Data Window. The locations where a plot*() function displays its results depend on the display parameter. By default, its value is display.all. The following example uses the plot() function to display the 1-bar change in the value of the built-in time variable measured in chart timeframes (e.g., a plotted value of 1 on the “1D” chart means there is a one-day difference between the opening times of the current and previous bars). Inspecting this series can help to identify time gaps in a chart’s data, which is helpful information when designing time-based indicators. Since we have not specified a display argument, the function uses display.all, meaning it will show data in all possible locations, as we see below: Note that: The numbers displayed in the script’s status line and the Data Window reflect the plotted values at the location of the chart’s cursor. These areas will show the latest bar’s value when the mouse pointer isn’t on the chart. The number in the price scale reflects the latest available value on the visible chart. Without affecting the scale When debugging multiple numeric values in a script, programmers may wish to inspect them without interfering with the price scales or cluttering the visual outputs in the chart’s pane, as distorted scales and overlapping plots may make it harder to evaluate the results. A simple way to inspect numbers without adding more visuals to the chart’s pane is to change the display values in the script’s plot*() calls to other display.* variables or expressions using them. Let’s look at a practical example. Here, we’ve drafted the following script that calculates a custom-weighted moving average by dividing the sum of weight * close values by the sum of the weight series: Suppose we’d like to inspect the variables used in the average calculation to understand and fine-tune the result. If we were to use plot() to display the script’s weight , numerator , and denominator in all locations, we can no longer easily identify our average line on the chart since each variable has a radically different scale: While we could hide individual plots from the “Style” tab of the script’s settings, doing so also prevents us from inspecting the results in any other location. To simultaneously view the variables’ values and preserve the scale of our chart, we can change the display values in our debug plots. The version below includes a debugLocations variable in the debug plot() calls with a value of display.all - display.pane to specify that all locations except the chart pane will show the results. Now we can inspect the calculation’s values without the extra clutter: From local scopes A script’s local scopes are sections of indented code within conditional structures, functions, and methods. When working with variables declared within these scopes, using the plot*() functions to display their values directly will not work, as plots only work with literals and global variables. To display a local variable’s values using plots, one can assign its results to a global variable and pass that variable to the plot*() call. For example, this script calculates the all-time maximum and minimum change in the close price over a lengthInput period. It uses an if structure to declare a local change variable and update the global maxChange and minChange once every lengthInput bars: Suppose we want to inspect the history of the change variable using a plot. While we cannot plot the variable directly since the script declares it in a local scope, we can assign its value to another global variable for use in a plot*() function. Below, we’ve added a debugChange variable with an initial value of na to the global scope, and the script reassigns its value within the if structure using the local change variable. Now, we can use plot() with the debugChange variable to view the history of available change values: Note that: The script uses plot.style_areabr in the debug plot, which doesn’t bridge over na values as the default style does. When the rightmost visible bar’s plotted value is na the number in the price scale represents the latest non-na value before that bar, if one exists. With drawings An alternative approach to graphically inspecting the history of a script’s numeric values is to use Pine’s drawing types, including lines, boxes, polylines, and labels. While Pine drawings don’t display results anywhere other than the chart pane, scripts can create them from within local scopes, including the scopes of functions and methods (see the Debugging functions section to learn more). Additionally, scripts can position drawings at any available chart location, irrespective of the current bar_index. For example, let’s revisit the “Periodic changes” script from the previous section. Suppose we’d like to inspect the history of the local change variable without using a plot. In this case, we can avoid declaring a separate global variable and instead create drawing objects directly from the if structure’s local scope. The script below is a modification of the previous script that uses boxes to visualize the change variable’s behavior. Inside the scope of the if structure, it calls box.new() to create a box that spans from the bar lengthInput bars ago to the current bar_index: Note that: The script includes max_boxes_count = 500 in the indicator() function, which allows it to show up to 500 boxes on the chart. We used math.max(change, 0.0) and math.min(change, 0.0) in the box.new() function as the top and bottom values. The box.new() call includes str.tostring(change) as its text argument to display a “string” representation of the change variable’s “float” value in each box drawing. See this portion of the Strings section below to learn more about representing data with strings. For more information about using boxes and other related drawing types, see our User Manual’s Lines and boxes page. Conditions Many scripts one will create in Pine involve declaring and evaluating conditions to dictate specific script actions, such as triggering different calculation patterns, visuals, signals, alerts, strategy orders, etc. As such, it’s imperative to understand how to inspect the conditions a script uses to ensure proper execution. As numbers One possible way to debug a script’s conditions is to define numeric values based on them, which allows programmers to inspect them using numeric approaches, such as those outlined in the previous section. Let’s look at a simple example. This script calculates the ratio between the ohlc4 price and the lengthInput -bar moving average. It assigns a condition to the priceAbove variable that returns true whenever the value of the ratio exceeds 1 (i.e., the price is above the average). To inspect the occurrences of the condition, we created a debugValue variable assigned to the result of an expression that uses the ternary ?: operator to return 1 when priceAbove is true and 0 otherwise. The script plots the variable’s value in all available locations: Note that: Representing “bool” values using numbers also allows scripts to display conditional shapes or characters at specific y-axis locations with plotshape() and plotchar(), and it facilitates conditional debugging with plotarrow(). See the next section to learn more. Plotting conditional shapes The plotshape() and plotchar() functions provide utility for debugging conditions, as they can plot shapes or characters at absolute or relative chart locations whenever they contain a true or non-na series argument. These functions can also display numeric representations of the series in the script’s status line and the Data Window, meaning they’re also helpful for debugging numbers. We show a simple, practical way to debug numbers with these functions in the Tips section. The chart locations of the plots depend on the location parameter, which is location.abovebar by default. Let’s inspect a condition using these functions. The following script calculates an RSI with a lengthInput length and a crossBelow variable whose value is the result of a condition that returns true when the RSI crosses below 30. It calls plotshape() to display a circle near the top of the pane each time the condition occurs: Note that: The status line and Data Window show a value of 1 when crossBelow is true and 0 when it’s false . Suppose we’d like to display the shapes at precise locations rather than relative to the chart pane. We can achieve this by using conditional numbers and location.absolute in the plotshape() call. In this example, we’ve modified the previous script by creating a debugNumber variable that returns the rsi value when crossBelow is true and na otherwise. The plotshape() function uses this new variable as its series argument and location.absolute as its location argument: Note that: Since we passed a numeric series to the function, our conditional plot now shows the values of the debugNumber in the status line and Data Window instead of 1 or 0. Another handy way to debug conditions is to use plotarrow(). This function plots an arrow with a location relative to the main chart prices whenever the series argument is nonzero and not na. The length of each arrow varies with the series value supplied. As with plotshape() and plotchar(), plotarrow() can also display numeric results in the status line and the Data Window. This example shows an alternative way to inspect our crossBelow condition using plotarrow(). In this version, we’ve set overlay to true in the indicator() function and added a plotarrow() call to visualize the conditional values. The debugNumber in this example measures how far the rsi dropped below 30 each time the condition occurs:
Notice that the results from this search also considered messages with “unconfirmed” as
matches since the word contains our query. We can omit these matches by selecting the
“Whole Word” checkbox in the options at the right of the search bar:
This filter also supports regular expressions (regex), which allow users to perform advanced
searches that match custom character patterns when selecting the “Regex” checkbox in the
search options. For example, this regex matches all entries that contain “average” followed by
a sequence representing a number greater than 0.5 and less than or equal to 1:
average:\s*(0\.[6-9]\d*|0\.5\d*[1-9]\d*|1\.0*)
Clicking the “Start date” icon opens a dialog that allows users to specify the date and time of
the first log shown in the results:
After specifying the starting point, a tag containing the starting time will appear above the log
history:
Users can filter results by debug level using the checkboxes available when selecting the
rightmost icon in the filtering options. Here, we’ve deactivated the “info” and “warning” levels
so the results will only contain “error” messages:
Using inputs
Another, more involved way to interactively filter a script’s logged results is to create inputs
linked to conditional logic that activates specific log.*() calls in the code.
Let’s look at an example. This code calculates an RMA of close prices and declares a few
unique conditions to form a compound condition. The script uses log.info() to display
important debugging information in the Pine Logs pane, including the values of the
compoundCondition variable and the “bool” variables that determine its result.
We declared the filterLogsInput , logStartInput , and logEndInput variables respectively
assigned to an input.bool() and two input.time() calls for custom log filtering. When
filterLogsInput is true , the script will only generate a new log if the bar’s time is between
the logStartInput and logEndInput values, allowing us to interactively isolate the entries
that occurred within a specific time range:
Note that:
The input.*() functions assigned to the filterLogsInput , logStartInput , and
logEndInput variables include a group argument to oragnize and distinguish them in
the script’s settings.
The input.time() calls include confirm = true so that we can interactively set the start
and end times directly on the chart. To reset the inputs, select “Reset points…” from the
options in the script’s “More” menu.
The condition that triggers each log.info() call includes barstate.isconfirmed to limit log
generation to confirmed bars.
Debugging functions
User-defined functions and methods are custom functions written by users. They
encapsulate sequences of operations that a script can invoke later in its execution.
Every user-defined function or method has a local scope that embeds into the script’s global
scope. The parameters in a function’s signature and the variables declared within the function
body belong to that function’s local scope, and they are not directly accessible to a script’s
outer scope or the scopes of other functions.
The segments below explain a few ways programmers can debug the values from a function’s
local scope. We will use this script as the starting point for our subsequent examples. It
contains a customMA() function that returns an exponential moving average whose
smoothing parameter varies based on the source distance outside the 25th and 75th
percentiles over length bars:
Extracting local variables
When a programmer wants to inspect a user-defined function’s local variables by plotting its
values, coloring the background or chart bars, etc., they must extract the values to the global
scope, as the built-in functions that produce such outputs can only accept global variables
and literals.
Since the values returned by a function are available to the scope where a call occurs, one
straightforward extraction approach is to have the function return a tuple containing all the
values that need inspection.
Here, we’ve modified the customMA() function to return a tuple containing all the function’s
calculated variables. Now, we can call the function with a tuple declaration to make the values
available in the global scope and inspect them with plots:
Note that:
We used display.all - display.pane for the plots of the outerRangeDebug ,
totalRangeDebug , and alphaDebug variables to avoid impacting the chart’s scale.
The script also uses a conditional color to highlight the chart pane’s background when
debugAlpha is 0, indicating the maValue does not change.
Another, more advanced way to extract the values of a function’s local variables is to pass
them to a reference type variable declared in the global scope.
Function scopes can access global variables for their calculations. While a script cannot
directly reassign the values of global variables from within a function’s scope, it can update
the elements or properties of those values if they are reference types, such as arrays,
matrices, maps, and user-defined types.
This version declares a debugData variable in the global scope that references a map with
“string” keys and “float” values. Within the local scope of the customMA() function, the script
puts key-value pairs containing each local variable’s name and value into the map. After
calling the function, the script plots the stored debugData values:
Note that:
We placed each map.put() call on the same line as each variable declaration, separated
by a comma, to keep things concise and avoid adding extra lines to the customMA()
code.
We used map.get() to retrieve each value for the debug plot() and bgcolor() calls.
Local drawings and logs
Unlike plot.*() functions and others that require values accessible to the global scope,
scripts can generate drawing objects and Pine Logs from directly within a function, allowing
programmers to flexibly debug its local variables without extracting values to the outer scope.
In this example, we used labels and Pine Logs to display string representations of the values
within the customMA() scope. Inside the function, the script calls str.format() to create a
formatted string representing the local scope’s data, then calls label.new() and log.info() to
respectively display the text on the chart in a tooltip and log an “info” message containing the
text in the Pine Logs pane:
Note that:
We included max_labels_count = 500 in the indicator() function to display labels for the
most recent 500 customMA() calls.
The function uses barstate.isconfirmed in an if statement to only call log.info() on
confirmed bars. It does not log a new message on each realtime tick.
Debugging loops
Loops are structures that repeatedly execute a code block based on a counter (for), the
contents of a collection (for…in), or a condition (while). They allow scripts to perform
repetitive tasks without the need for redundant lines of code.
Each loop instance maintains a separate local scope, which all outer scopes cannot access.
All variables declared within a loop’s scope are specific to that loop, meaning one cannot use
them in an outer scope.
As with other structures in Pine, there are numerous possible ways to debug loops. This
section explores a few helpful techniques, including extracting local values for plots,
inspecting values with drawings, and tracing a loop’s execution with Pine Logs.
We will use this script as a starting point for the examples in the following segments. It
aggregates the close value’s rates of change over 1 - lookbackInput bars and accumulates
them in a for loop, then divides the result by the lookbackInput to calculate a final average
value:
Note that:
The aroc is a global variable modified within the loop, whereas pastClose and roc
are local variables inaccessible to the outer scope.
Inspecting a single iteration
When a programmer needs to focus on a specific loop iteration, there are multiple techniques
they can use, most of which entail using a condition inside the loop to trigger debugging
actions, such as extracting values to outer variables, creating drawings, logging messages,
etc.
This example inspects the local roc value from a single iteration of the loop in three different
ways. When the loop counter’s value equals the debugCounterInput , the script assigns the
roc to an rocDebug variable from the global scope for plotting, draws a vertical line from 0
to the roc value using line.new(), and logs a message in the Pine Logs pane using log.info():
Note that:
The input.int() call assigned to the debugCounterInput includes a group argument to
distinguish it in the script’s settings.
The log.info() call includes “(confirmed)” in the formatted message whenever
barstate.isconfirmed is true . Searching this text in the Pine Logs pane will filter out the
entries from unconfirmed bars. See the Filtering logs section above.
Inspecting multiple iterations
When inspecting the values from several loop iterations, it’s often helpful to utilize collections
or strings to gather the results for use in output functions after the loop terminates.
This version demonstrates a few ways to collect and display the loop’s values from all
iterations. It declares a logText string and a debugValues array in the global scope. Inside
the local scope of the for loop, the script concatenates a string representation of the length
and roc with the logText and calls array.push() to push the iteration’s roc value into the
debugValues array.
After the loop ends, the script plots the first and last value from the debugValues array, draws
a label with a tooltip showing a string representation of the array, and displays the logText in
the Pine Logs pane upon the bar’s confirmation:
Another way to inspect a loop over several iterations is to generate sequential Pine Logs or
create/modify drawing objects within the loop’s scope to trace its execution pattern with
granular detail.
This example uses Pine Logs to trace the execution flow of our script’s loop. It generates a
new “info” message on each iteration to track the local scope’s calculations as the loop
progresses on each confirmed bar:
Note that:
When iteratively generating logs or drawings from inside a loop, make it a point to avoid
unnecessary clutter and strive for easy navigation. More is not always better for
debugging, especially when working within loops.
Tips
Organization and readability
When writing scripts, it’s wise to prioritize organized, readable source codes. Code that’s
organized and easy to read helps streamline the debugging process. Additionally, well-written
code is easier to maintain over time.
Here are a few quick tips based on our Style guide and the examples on this page:
Aim to follow the general script organization recommendations. Organizing scripts using
this structure makes things easier to locate and inspect.
Choose variable and function names that make them easy to identify and understand.
See the Naming conventions section for some examples.
It’s often helpful to temporarily assign important parts of expressions to variables with
informative names while debugging. Breaking expressions down into reusable parts
helps simplify inspection processes.
Use comments and annotations ( //@function , //@variable , etc.) to document your
code. Annotations are particularly helpful, as the Pine Editor’s autosuggest displays
variable and function descriptions in a pop-up when hovering over their identifiers
anywhere in the code.
Remember that less is more in many cases. Don’t overwhelm yourself with excessive
script outputs or unnecessary information while debugging. Keep things simple, and
only include as much information as you need.
Speeding up repetitive tasks
There are a few handy techniques we often utilize when debugging our code:
We use plotchar() or plotshape() to quickly display the results of “int”, “float”, or “bool”
variables and expressions in the script’s status line and the Data Window.
We often use bgcolor() to visualize the history of certain conditions on the chart.
We use a one-line version of our printLabel() function from this section to print
strings at the end of the chart.
We use a label.new() call with a tooltip argument to display strings in tooltips on
successive bars.
We use the log.*() functions to quickly display data with string representations in the
Pine Logs pane.
When one establishes their typical debugging processes, it’s often helpful to create keyboard
macros to speed up repetitive tasks and spend less time setting up debug outputs in each
code.
The following is a simple AutoHotkey script (not Pine Script™ code) that includes hotstrings
for the above five techniques. The script generates code snippets by entering a specified
character sequence followed by a whitespace:
The “,,show” macro generates a plotchar() call that uses the clipboard’s contents for the
series and title arguments. Copying a variableName variable or the close > open
expression and typing “,,show” followed by a space will respectively yield:
The “,,highlight” macro generates a bgcolor() call that highlights the chart pane’s background
with a conditional color based on the variable or expression copied to the clipboard. For
example, copying the barstate.isrealtime variable and typing “,,highlight” followed by a space
will yield:
The “,,print” macro generates the one-line printLabel() function and creates an empty
printLabel() call with the cursor placed inside it. All you need to do after typing “,,print”
followed by a space is enter the text you want to display:
The “,,tooltip” macro generates a label.new() call with a tooltip argument that uses
str.tostring() on the clipboard’s contents. Copying the variableName variable and typing
“,,tooltip” followed by a space yields:
The “,,log” macro generates a log.info() call with a message argument that uses str.tostring()
on the clipboard’s contents to display string representations of variables and expressions in
the Pine Logs pane. Copying the expression bar_index % 2 == 0 and typing “,,log” followed
by a space yields:
Note that:
AHK is available for Windows devices. Research other software to employ a similar
process if your machine uses a different operating system.

User Manual / Writing scripts / Profiling and optimization Profiling and optimization Introduction Pine Script™ is a cloud-based compiled language geared toward efficient repeated script execution. When a user adds a Pine script to a chart, it executes numerous times, once for each available bar or tick in the data feeds it accesses, as explained in this manual’s Execution model page. The Pine Script™ compiler automatically performs several internal optimizations to accommodate scripts of various sizes and help them run smoothly. However, such optimizations do not prevent performance bottlenecks in script executions. As such, it’s up to programmers to profile a script’s runtime performance and identify ways to modify critical code blocks and lines when they need to improve execution times. This page covers how to profile and monitor a script’s runtime and executions with the Pine Profiler and explains some ways programmers can modify their code to optimize runtime performance. For a quick introduction, see the following video, where we profile an example script and optimize it step-by-step, examining several common script inefficiencies and explaining how to avoid them along the way: Pine Profiler Before diving into optimization, it’s prudent to evaluate a script’s runtime and pinpoint bottlenecks, i.e., areas in the code that substantially impact overall performance. With these insights, programmers can ensure they focus on optimizing where it truly matters instead of spending time and effort on low-impact code. Enter the Pine Profiler, a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all significant code lines and blocks in a script and displays helpful performance information next to the lines inside the Pine Editor. By inspecting the Profiler’s results, programmers can gain a clearer perspective on a script’s overall runtime, the distribution of runtime across its significant code regions, and the critical portions that may need extra attention and optimization. Profiling a script The Pine Profiler can analyze the runtime performance of any editable script coded in Pine Script™ v6. To profile a script, add it to the chart, open the source code in the Pine Editor, and select “Enable profiler mode” from the dropdown next to the “Add to chart/Update on chart” option in the top-right corner: We will use the script below for our initial profiling example, which calculates a custom oscillator based on average distances from the close price to upper and lower percentiles over lengthInput bars. It includes a few different types of significant code regions, which come with some differences in interpretation while profiling: Once enabled, the Profiler collects information from all executions of the script’s significant code lines and blocks, then displays bars and approximate runtime percentages to the left of the code lines inside the Pine Editor: Note that: The Profiler tracks every execution of a significant code region, including the executions on realtime ticks. Its information updates over time as new executions occur. Profiler results do not appear for script declaration statements, type declarations, other insignificant code lines such as variable declarations with no tangible impact, unused code that the script’s outputs do not depend on, or repetitive code that the compiler optimizes during translation. See this section for more information. When a script contains at least four significant lines of code, the Profiler will include “flame” icons next to the top three code regions with the highest performance impact. If one or more of the highest-impact code regions are outside the lines visible inside the Pine Editor, a “flame” icon and a number indicating how many critical lines are outside the view will appear at the top or bottom of the left margin. Clicking the icon will vertically scroll the Editor’s window to show the nearest critical line: Hovering the mouse pointer over the space next to a line highlights the analyzed code and exposes a tooltip with additional information, including the time spent and the number of executions. The information shown next to each line and in the corresponding tooltip depends on the profiled code region. The section below explains different types of code the Profiler analyzes and how to interpret their performance results. Interpreting profiled results Single-line results For a code line containing single-line expressions, the Profiler bar and displayed percentage represent the relative portion of the script’s total runtime spent on that line. The corresponding tooltip displays three fields: The “Line number” field indicates the analyzed code line. The “Time” field shows the runtime percentage for the line of code, the runtime spent on that line, and the script’s total runtime. The “Executions” field shows the number of times that specific line executed while running the script. Here, we hovered the pointer over the space next to line 12 of our profiled code to view its tooltip: Note that: The time information for the line represents the time spent completing all executions, not the time spent on a single execution. To estimate the average time spent per execution, divide the line’s time by the number of executions. In this case, the tooltip shows that line 12 took about 14.1 milliseconds to execute 20,685 times, meaning the average time per execution was approximately 14.1 ms / 20685 = 0.0006816534 milliseconds (0.6816534 microseconds). When a line of code consists of more than one expression separated by commas, the number of executions shown in the tooltip represents the sum of each expression’s total executions, and the time value displayed represents the total time spent evaluating all the line’s expressions. For instance, this global line from our initial example includes two variable declarations separated by commas. Each uses the var keyword, meaning the script only executes them once on the first available bar. As we see in the Profiler tooltip for the line, it counted two executions (one for each expression), and the time value shown is the combined result from both expressions on the line: Note that: When analyzing scripts with more than one expression on the same line, we recommend moving each expression to a separate line for more detailed insights while profiling, namely if they may contain higher-impact calculations. When using line wrapping for readability or stylistic purposes, the Profiler considers all portions of a wrapped line as part of the first line where it starts in the Pine Editor. For example, although this code from our initial script occupies more than one line in the Pine Editor, it’s still treated as a single line of code, and the Profiler tooltip displays single-line results, with the “Line number” field showing the first line in the Editor that the wrapped line occupies: Code block results For a line at the start of a loop or conditional structure, the Profiler bar and percentage represent the relative portion of the script’s runtime spent on the entire code block, not just the single line. The corresponding tooltip displays four fields: The “Code block range” field indicates the range of lines included in the structure. The “Time” field shows the code block’s runtime percentage, the time spent on all block executions, and the script’s total runtime. The “Line time” field shows the runtime percentage for the block’s initial line, the time spent on that line, and the script’s total runtime. The interpretation differs for switch blocks or if blocks with else if statements, as the values represent the total time spent on all the structure’s conditional statements. See below for more information. The “Executions” field shows the number of times the code block executed while running the script. Here, we hovered over the space next to line 19 in our initial script, the beginning of a simple if structure without else if statements. As we see below, the tooltip shows performance information for the entire code block and the current line: Note that: The “Time” field shows that the total time spent evaluating the structure 20,685 times was 7.2 milliseconds. The “Line time” field indicates that the runtime spent on the first line of this if structure was about three milliseconds. Users can also inspect the results from lines and nested blocks within a code block’s range to gain more granular performance insights. Here, we hovered over the space next to line 20 within the code block to view its single-line result: Note that: The number of executions shown is less than the result for the entire code block, as the condition that controls the execution of this line does not return true all the time. The opposite applies to the code inside loops since each execution of a loop statement can trigger several executions of the loop’s local block. When profiling a switch structure or an if structure that includes else if statements, the “Line time” field will show the time spent executing all the structure’s conditional expressions, not just the block’s first line. The results for the lines inside the code block range will show runtime and executions for each local block. This format is necessary for these structures due to the Profiler’s calculation and display constraints. See this section for more information. For example, the “Line time” for the switch structure in this script represents the time spent evaluating all four conditional statements within its body, as the Profiler cannot track them separately. The results for each line in the code block’s range represent the performance information for each local block: When the conditional logic in such structures involves significant calculations, programmers may require more granular performance information for each calculated condition. An effective way to achieve this analysis is to use nested if blocks instead of the more compact switch or if…else if structures. For example, instead of: or: one can use nested if blocks for more in-depth profiling while maintaining the same logical flow: Below, we changed the previous switch example to an equivalent nested if structure. Now, we can view the runtime and executions for each significant part of the conditional pattern individually: Note that: This same process can also apply to ternary expressions. When a complex ternary expression’s operands contain significant calculations, reorganizing the logic into a nested if structure allows more detailed Profiler results, making it easier to spot critical parts. User-defined function calls User-defined functions and methods are functions written by users. They encapsulate code sequences that a script may execute several times. Users often write functions and methods for improved code modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The indented lines of code within a function represent its local scope, i.e., the sequence that executes each time the script calls it. Unlike code in a script’s global scope, which a script evaluates once on each execution, the code inside a function may activate zero, one, or multiple times on each script execution, depending on the conditions that trigger the calls, the number of calls that occur, and the function’s logic. This distinction is crucial to consider while interpreting Profiler results. When a profiled code contains user-defined function or method calls: The results for each function call reflect the runtime allocated toward it and the total number of times the script activated that specific call. The time and execution information for all local code inside a function’s scope reflects the combined results from all calls to the function. This example contains a user-defined similarity() function that estimates the similarity of two series, which the script calls only once from the global scope on each execution. In this case, the Profiler’s results for the code inside the function’s body correspond to that specific call: Let’s increase the number of times the script calls the function each time it executes. Here, we changed the script to call our user-defined function five times: In this case, the local code results no longer correspond to a single evaluation per script execution. Instead, they represent the combined runtime and executions of the local code from all five calls. As we see below, the results after running this version of the script across the same data show 137,905 executions of the local code, five times the number from when the script only contained one similarity() function call: When requesting other contexts Pine scripts can request data from other contexts, i.e., different symbols, timeframes, or data modifications than what the chart’s data uses by calling the request.*() family of functions or specifying an alternate timeframe in the indicator() declaration statement. When a script requests data from another context, it evaluates all required scopes and calculations within that context, as explained in the Other timeframes and data page. This behavior can affect the runtime of a script’s code regions and the number of times they execute. The Profiler information for any code line or block represents the results from executing the code in all necessary contexts, which may or may not include the chart’s data. Pine Script™ determines which contexts to execute code within based on the calculations required by a script’s data requests and outputs. Let’s look at a simple example. This initial script only uses the chart’s data for its calculations. It declares a pricesArray variable with the varip keyword, meaning the array assigned to it persists across the data’s history and all available realtime ticks. On each execution, the script calls array.push() to push a new close value into the array, and it plots the array’s size. After profiling the script across all the bars on an intraday chart, we see that the number of elements in the pricesArray corresponds to the number of executions the Profiler shows for the array.push() call on line 8: Now, let’s try evaluating the size of the pricesArray from another context instead of using the chart’s data. Below, we’ve added a request.security() call with array.size(pricesArray) as its expression argument to retrieve the value calculated on the “1D” timeframe and plotted that result instead. In this case, the number of executions the Profiler shows on line 8 still corresponds to the number of elements in the pricesArray . However, it did not execute the same number of times since the script did not require the chart’s data in the calculations. It only needed to initialize the array and evaluate array.push() across all the requested daily data, which has a different number of price updates than our current intraday chart: Note that: The requested EOD data in this example had fewer data points than our intraday chart, so the array.push() call required fewer executions in this case. However, EOD feeds do not have history limitations, meaning it’s also possible for requested HTF data to span more bars than a user’s chart, depending on the timeframe, the data provider, and the user’s plan. If this script were to plot the array.size() value directly in addition to the requested daily value, it would then require the creation of two arrays (one for each context) and the execution of array.push() across both the chart’s data and the data from the daily timeframe. As such, the declaration on line 5 will execute twice, and the results on line 8 will reflect the time and executions accumulated from evaluating the array.push() call across both separate datasets: It’s important to note that when a script calls a user-defined function or method that contains request.*() calls in its local scope, the script’s translated form extracts the request.*() calls outside the scope and encapsulates the expressions they depend on within separate functions. When the script executes, it evaluates the required request.*() calls first, then passes the requested data to a modified form of the user-defined function. Since the translated script executes a user-defined function’s data requests separately before evaluating non-requested calculations in its local scope, the Profiler’s results for lines containing calls to the function will not include the time spent on its request.*() calls or their required expressions. As an example, the following script contains a user-defined getCompositeAvg() function with a request.security() call that requests the math.avg() of 10 ta.wma() calls with different length arguments from a specified symbol . The script uses the function to request the average result using a Heikin Ashi ticker ID: After profiling the script, users might be surprised to see that the runtime results shown inside the function’s body heavily exceed the results shown for the single getCompositeAvg() call: The results appear this way since the translated script includes internal modifications that moved the request.security() call and its expression outside the function’s scope, and the Profiler has no way to represent the results from those calculations other than displaying them next to the request.security() line in this scenario. The code below roughly illustrates how the translated script looks: Note that: The secExpr() code represents the separate function used by request.security() to calculate the required expression in the requested context. The request.security() call takes place in the outer scope, outside the getCompositeAvg() function. The translation substantially reduced the local code of getCompositeAvg() . It now solely returns a value passed into it, as all the function’s required calculations take place outside its scope. Due to this reduction, the function call’s performance results will not reflect any of the time spent on the data request’s required calculations. Insignificant, unused, and redundant code When inspecting a profiled script’s results, it’s crucial to understand that not all code in a script necessarily impacts runtime performance. Some code has no direct performance impact, such as a script’s declaration statement and type declarations. Other code regions with insignificant expressions, such as most input.*() calls, variable references, or variable declarations without significant calculations, have little to no effect on a script’s runtime. Therefore, the Profiler will not display performance results for these types of code. Additionally, Pine scripts do not execute code regions that their outputs (plots, drawings, logs, etc.) do not depend on, as the compiler automatically removes them during translation. Since unused code regions have zero impact on a script’s performance, the Profiler will not display any results for them. The following example contains a barsInRange variable and a for loop that adds 1 to the variable’s value for each historical close price between the current high and low over lengthInput bars. However, the script does not use these calculations in its outputs, as it only plots the close price. Consequently, the script’s compiled form discards that unused code and only considers the plot(close) call. The Profiler does not display any results for this script since it does not execute any significant calculations: Note that: Although this script does not use the input.int() from line 5 and discards all its associated calculations, the “Length” input will still appear in the script’s settings, as the compiler does not completely remove unused inputs. If we change the script to plot the barsInRange value instead, the declared variables and the for loop are no longer unused since the output depends on them, and the Profiler will now display performance information for that code: Note that: The Profiler does not show performance information for the lengthInput declaration on line 5 or the barsInRange declaration on line 8 since the expressions on these lines do not impact the script’s performance. When possible, the compiler also simplifies certain instances of redundant code in a script, such as some forms of identical expressions with the same fundamental type values. This optimization allows the compiled script to only execute such calculations once, on the first occurrence, and reuse the calculated result for each repeated instance that the outputs depend on. If a script contains repetitive code and the compiler simplifies it, the Profiler will only show results for the first occurrence of the code since that’s the only time the script requires the calculation. For example, this script contains a code line that plots the value of ta.sma(close, 100) and 12 code lines that plot the value of ta.sma(close, 500): Since the last 12 lines all contain identical ta.sma() calls, the compiler can automatically simplify the script so that it only needs to evaluate ta.sma(close, 500) once per execution rather than repeating the calculation 11 more times. As we see below, the Profiler only shows results for lines 5 and 9. These are the only parts of the code requiring significant calculations since the ta.sma() calls on lines 10-20 are redundant in this case: Another type of repetitive code optimization occurs when a script contains two or more user- defined functions or methods with identical compiled forms. In such a case, the compiler simplifies the script by removing the redundant functions, and the script will treat all calls to the redundant functions as calls to the first defined version. Therefore, the Profiler will only show local code performance results for the first function since the discarded “clones” will never execute. For instance, the script below contains two user-defined functions, metallicRatio() and calcMetallic() , that calculate a metallic ratio of a given order raised to a specified exponent: Despite the differences in the function and parameter names, the two functions are otherwise identical, which the compiler detects while translating the script. In this case, it discards the redundant calcMetallic() function, and the compiled script treats the calcMetallic() call as a metallicRatio() call. As we see here, the Profiler shows performance information for the calcMetallic() and metallicRatio() calls on lines 21 and 22, but it does not show any results for the local code of the calcMetallic() function on line 18. Instead, the Profiler’s information on line 13 within the metallicRatio() function reflects the local code results from both function calls: A look into the Profiler’s inner workings The Pine Profiler wraps all necessary code regions with specialized internal functions to track and collect required information across script executions. It then passes the information to additional calculations that organize and display the performance results inside the Pine Editor. This section gives users a peek into how the Profiler applies internal functions to wrap Pine code and collect performance data. There are two main internal (non-Pine) functions the Profiler wraps significant code with to facilitate runtime analysis. The first function retrieves the current system time at specific points in the script’s execution, and the second maps cumulative elapsed time and execution data to specific code regions. We represent these functions in this explanation as System.timeNow() and registerPerf() respectively. When the Profiler detects code that requires analysis, it adds System.timeNow() above the code to get the initial time before execution. Then, it adds registerPerf() below the code to map and accumulate the elapsed time and number of executions. The elapsed time added on each registerPerf() call is the System.timeNow() value after the execution minus the value before the execution. The following pseudocode outlines this process for a single line of code, where _startX represents the starting time for the lineX line: The process is similar for code blocks. The difference is that the registerPerf() call maps the data to a range of lines rather than a single line. Here, lineX represents the first line in the code block, and lineY represents the block’s last line: Note that: In the above snippets, long , System.timeNow() , and registerPerf() represent
calculation since it consistently changes over time.
In the modified script below, we’ve added a weights variable to reference an array that
stores each calculated weight . This variable and the denominator both include the var
keyword in their declarations, meaning the values assigned to them will persist throughout all
script executions until explicitly reassigned. The script calculates their values using a for loop
that only executes on the first chart bar. Across all other bars, it calculates the numerator
using a for…in loop that references the saved values from the weights array:
With this optimized structure, the profiled results show that our modified script with a high
lengthInput value of 2500 took about 5.9 seconds to calculate across the same data, about
half the time of our previous version:
Note that:
Although we’ve significantly improved this script’s performance by saving its executioninvariant
values to variables, it does still involve a higher computational cost with large
lengthInput values due to the remaining loop calculations that execute on each bar.
Another, more advanced way one can further enhance this script’s performance is by
storing the weights in a single-rowmatrix on the first bar, using an array as a queue to
hold recent close values, then replacing the for…in loop with a call to matrix.mult(). See
the Matrices page to learn more about working with matrix.*() functions.
Eliminating loops
Loops allow Pine scripts to perform iterative calculations on each execution. Each time a loop
activates, its local code may execute several times, often leading to a substantial increase in
resource usage.
Pine loops are necessary for some calculations, such as manipulating elements within
collections or looking backward through a dataset’s history to calculate values only obtainable
on the current bar. However, in many other cases, programmers use loops when they don’t
need to, leading to suboptimal runtime performance. In such cases, one may eliminate
unnecessary loops in any of the following ways, depending on what their calculations entail:
Identifying simplified, loop-free expressions that achieve the same result without
iteration
Replacing a loop with optimized built-ins where possible
Distributing a loop’s iterations across bars when feasible rather than evaluating them all
at once
This simple example contains an avgDifference() function that calculates the average
difference between the current bar’s source value and all the values from length previous
bars. The script calls this function to calculate the average difference between the current
close price and lengthInput previous prices, then it plots the result on the chart:
After inspecting the script’s profiled results with the default settings, we see that it took about
64 milliseconds to execute 20,157 times:
Since we use the lengthInput as the length argument in the avgDifference() call and
that argument controls how many times the loop inside the function must iterate, our script’s
runtime will grow with the lengthInput value. Here, we set the input’s value to 2000 in the
script’s settings. This time, the script completed its executions in about 3.8 seconds:
As we see from these results, the avgDifference() function can be costly to call, depending
on the specified lengthInput value, due to its for loop that executes on each bar. However,
loops are not necessary to achieve the output. To understand why, let’s take a closer look at
the loop’s calculations. We can represent them with the following expression:
Notice that it adds the current source value length times. These iterative additions are not
necessary. We can simplify that part of the expression to source * length , which reduces it
to the following:
or equivalently:
After simplifying and rearranging this representation of the loop’s calculations, we see that we
can compute the result in a simpler way and eliminate the loop by subtracting the previous
bar’s rolling sum of source values from the source * length value, i.e.:
The fastAvgDifference() function below is a loop-free alternative to the original
avgDifference() function that uses the above expression to calculate the sum of source
differences, then divides the expression by the length to return the average difference:
Now that we’ve identified a potential optimized solution, we can compare the performance of
fastAvgDifference() to the original avgDifference() function. The script below is a
modified form of the previous version that plots the results from calling both functions with
the lengthInput as the length argument:
The profiled results for the script with the default lengthInput of 20 show a substantial
difference in runtime spent on the two function calls. The call to the original function took
about 47.3 milliseconds to execute 20,157 times on this run, whereas our optimized function
only took 4.5 milliseconds:
Now, let’s compare the performance with the heavier lengthInput value of 2000. As before,
the runtime spent on the avgDifference() function increased significantly. However, the time
spent executing the fastAvgDifference() call remained very close to the result from the
previous configuration. In other words, while our original function’s runtime scales directly
with its length argument, our optimized function demonstrates relatively consistent
performance since it does not require a loop:
Optimizing loops
Although Pine’s execution model and the available built-ins often eliminate the need for loops
in many cases, there are still instances where a script will require loops for some types of
tasks, including:
Manipulating collections or executing calculations over a collection’s elements when the
available built-ins will not suffice
Performing calculations across historical bars that one cannot achieve with simplified
loop-free expressions or optimized built-ins
Calculating values that are only obtainable through iteration
When a script uses loops that a programmer cannot eliminate, there are several techniques
one can use to reduce their performance impact. This section explains two of the most
common, useful techniques that can help improve a required loop’s efficiency.
Reducing loop calculations
The code executed within a loop’s local scope can have a multiplicative impact on its overall
runtime, as each time a loop statement executes, it will typically trigger several iterations of
the local code. Therefore, programmers should strive to keep a loop’s calculations as simple
as possible by eliminating unnecessary structures, function calls, and operations to minimize
the performance impact, especially when the script must evaluate its loops numerous times
throughout all its executions.
For example, this script contains a filteredMA() function that calculates a moving average
of up to length unique source values, depending on the true elements in a specified
mask array. The function queues the unique source values into a data array, uses a for…in
loop to iterate over the data and calculate the numerator and denominator sums, then
returns the ratio of those sums. Within the loop, it only adds values to the sums when the
data element is not na and the mask element at the index is true . The script utilizes this
user-defined function to calculate the average of up to 100 unique close prices filtered by a
randMask and plots the result on the chart:
After profiling the script, we see it took about two seconds to execute 21,778 times. The code
with the highest performance impact is the expression on line 37, which calls the
filteredMA() function. Within the filteredMA() function’s scope, the for…in loop has the
highest impact, with the index calculation in the loop’s scope (line 22) contributing the most
to the loop’s runtime:
The above code demonstrates suboptimal usage of a for…in loop, as we do not need to call
array.indexof() to retrieve the index in this case. The array.indexof() function can be costly to
call within a loop since it must search through the array’s contents and locate the
corresponding element’s index each time the script calls it.
To eliminate this costly call from our for…in loop, we can use the second form of the structure,
which produces a tuple containing the index and the element’s value on each iteration:
In this version of the script, we removed the array.indexof() call on line 22 since it is not
necessary to achieve the intended result, and we changed the for…in loop to use the
alternative form:
With this simple change, our loop is much more efficient, as it no longer needs to redundantly
search through the array on each iteration to keep track of the index. The profiled results from
this script run show that it took only 0.6 seconds to complete its executions, a significant
improvement over the previous version’s result:
Loop-invariant code motion
Loop-invariant code is any code region within a loop’s scope that produces an unchanging
result on each iteration. When a script’s loops contain loop-invariant code, it can substantially
impact performance in some cases due to excessive, unnecessary calculations.
Programmers can optimize a loop with invariant code by moving the unchanging calculations
outside the loop’s scope so the script only needs to evaluate them once per execution rather
than repetitively.
The following example contains a featureScale() function that creates a rescaled version of
an array. Within the function’s for…in loop, it scales each element by calculating its distance
from the array.min() and dividing the value by the array.range(). The script uses this function
to create a rescaled version of a prices array and plots the difference between the
rescaled.first() and rescaled.avg() values on the chart:
As we see below, the profiled results for this script after 20,187 executions show it completed
its run in about 3.3 seconds. The code with the highest impact on performance is the line
containing the featureScale() function call, and the function’s critical code is the for…in
loop block starting on line 7:
Upon examining the loop’s calculations, we can see that the array.min() and array.range() calls
on line 8 are loop-invariant, as they will always produce the same result across each
iteration. We can make our loop much more efficient by assigning the results from these calls
to variables outside its scope and referencing them as needed.
The featureScale() function in the script below assigns the array.min() and array.range()
values to minValue and rangeValue variables before executing the for…in loop. Inside the
loop’s local scope, it references the variables across its iterations rather than repetitively
calling these array.*() functions:
As we see from the script’s profiled results, moving the loop-invariant calculations outside the
loop leads to a substantial performance improvement. This time, the script completed its
executions in only 289.3 milliseconds:
Minimizing historical buffer calculations
Pine scripts create historical buffers for all variables and function calls their outputs depend
on. Each buffer contains information about the range of historical values the script can access
with the history-referencing operator [].
A script automatically determines the required buffer size for all its variables and function
calls by analyzing the historical references executed during the first 244 bars in a dataset.
When a script only references the history of a calculated value after those initial bars, it will
restart its executions repetitively across previous bars with successively larger historical
buffers until it either determines the appropriate size or raises a runtime error. Those
repetitive executions can significantly increase a script’s runtime in some cases.
When a script excessively executes across a dataset to calculate historical buffers, one
effective way to improve its performance is explicitly defining suitable buffer sizes using the
max_bars_back() function. With appropriate buffer sizes declared explicitly, the script does
not need to re-execute across past data to determine the sizes.
For example, the script below uses a polyline to draw a basic histogram representing the
distribution of calculated source values over 500 bars. On the last available bar, the script
uses a for loop to look back through historical values of the calculated source series and
determine the chart points used by the polyline drawing. It also plots the value of bar_index +
1 to verify the number of bars it executed across:
Since the script only references past source values on the last bar, it will not construct a
suitable historical buffer for the series within the first 244 bars on a larger dataset.
Consequently, it will re-execute across all historical bars to identify the appropriate buffer
size.
As we see from the profiled results after running the script across 20,320 bars, the number of
global code executions was 162,560, which is eight times the number of chart bars. In other
words, the script had to repeat the historical executions seven more times to determine the
appropriate buffer for the source series in this case:
This script will only reference the most recent 500 source values on the last historical bar
and all realtime bars. Therefore, we can help it establish the correct buffer without reexecution
by defining a 500-bar referencing length with max_bars_back().
In the following script version, we added max_bars_back(source, 500) after the variable
declaration to explicitly specify that the script will access up to 500 historical source values
throughout its executions:
With this change, our script no longer needs to re-execute across all the historical data to
determine the buffer size. As we see in the profiled results below, the number of global code
executions now aligns with the number of chart bars, and the script took substantially less
time to complete all of its historical executions:
Note that:
This script only requires up to the most recent 501 historical bars to calculate its
drawing output. In this case, another way to optimize resource usage is to include
calc_bars_count = 501 in the indicator() function, which reduces unnecessary script
executions by restricting the historical data the script can calculate across to 501 bars.
Tips
Working around Profiler overhead
Since the Pine Profiler must perform extra calculations to collect performance data, as
explained in this section, the time it takes to execute a script increases while profiling.
Most scripts will run as expected with the Profiler’s overhead included. However, when a
complex script’s runtime approaches a plan’s limit, using the Profiler on it may cause its
runtime to exceed the limit. Such a case indicates that the script likely needs optimization, but
it can be challenging to know where to start without being able to profile the code. The most
effective workaround in this scenario is reducing the number of bars the script must execute
on. Users can achieve this reduction in any of the following ways:
Selecting a dataset that has fewer data points in its history, e.g., a higher timeframe or a
symbol with limited data
Using conditional logic to limit code executions to a specific time or bar range
Including a calc_bars_count argument in the script’s declaration statement to specify
how many recent historical bars it can use
Reducing the number of data points works in most cases because it directly decreases the
number of times the script must execute, typically resulting in less accumulated runtime.
As a demonstration, this script contains a gcd() function that uses a naive algorithm to
calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. The function initializes its result
using the smallest absolute value of the two numbers. Then, it reduces the value of the
result by one within a while loop until it can divide both numbers without remainders. This
structure entails that the loop will iterate up to N times, where N is the smallest of the two
arguments.
In this example, the script plots the value of gcd(10000, 10000 + bar_index) . The smallest of
the two arguments is always 10,000 in this case, meaning the while loop within the function
will require up to 10,000 iterations per script execution, depending on the bar_index value:
When we add the script to our chart, it takes a while to execute across our chart’s data, but it
does not raise an error. However, after enabling the Profiler, the script raises a runtime error
stating that it exceeded the Premium plan’s runtime limit (40 seconds):
Our current chart has over 20,000 historical bars, which may be too many for the script to
handle within the alloted time while the Profiler is active. We can try limiting the number of
historical executions to work around the issue in this case.
Below, we included calc_bars_count = 10000 in the indicator() function, which limits the
script’s available history to the most recent 10,000 historical bars. After restricting the script’s
historical executions, it no longer exceeds the Premium plan’s limit while profiling, so we can
now inspect its performance results:

As with profiling tools for other languages, the Pine Profiler wraps a script and its significant code with extra calculations required to collect performance data.

Therefore, one should interpret the results as estimates rather than precise performance measurements. Furthermore, the Profiler cannot collect and display individual performance data for the internal calculations that also affect runtime, including the calculations required to track performance, meaning the time values shown for all a script’s code regions will not add up to exactly 100% of its overall runtime.

When the local scopes of a script’s user-defined functions or methods contain calls to request.*() functions, the translated form of the script extracts such calls outside the functions’ scopes and evaluates them separately. Consequently, the Profiler’s results for lines with calls to those user-defined functionswill not include the time spent on the request.*() calls. See the section below to learn more.

Notice! Not all iterative calculations will necessarily have loop-free alternatives. In the
case where a script can only achieve its results through iteration, programmers can
identify possible ways to optimize loops to improve performance. See the next section
for more information.
Notice! Before identifying ways to optimize a loop, we recommend searching for ways
to eliminate it first. If no solution exists that makes the loop unnecessary, then
proceed with attempting to reduce its overhead.

Notice!
When explicitly defining a buffer size for a problematic historical reference with
max_bars_back(), it’s imperative to ensure that the script will not use more data than
specified later in its executions, as the script will still re-execute on historical bars and
try to calculate the buffer if the user-specified size is insufficient.
Another consideration when explicitly defining buffer sizes is that the larger the buffer,
the larger the memory cost. As such, programmers should aim to keep the explicit
buffer length limited to only the maximum number of historical values the script will
reference and not more. For example, defining a 5000-bar buffer when a script only
requires 500 historical values will result in an unnecessary waste of memory.

Notice! This process may require trial and error, as determining the number of
executions that a computationally heavy script can handle before timing out is not
necessarily straightforward. If a script takes too long to execute after enabling the
Profiler, experiment with different ways to limit its executions until you can profile it
successfully.

Publishing scripts
Publishing
scripts
Programmers who wish to share their Pine scripts with other traders can publish them.
Script visibility and
access
When you publish a script, you control its
visibility
and
access
:
Visibility
is controlled by choosing to publish
publicly
or
privately
. See
How do privateideas and scripts differ from public ones?
in the Help Center for more details. Publishpublicly when you have written a script you think can be useful to TradingViewers. Publicscripts are subject to moderation. To avoid moderation, ensure your publicationcomplies with our
House Rules
and
Script Publishing Rules
. Publish privately when youdon’t want your script visible to all other users, but want to share it with a few friends.
Access
determines if users will see your source code, and how they will be able to useyour script. There are three access types:
open
,
protected
(reserved to paid accounts)or
invite-only
(reserved to Premium accounts). See
What are the different types ofpublished scripts?
in the Help Center for more details.
When you publish a
script
The publication’s title is determined by the argument used for the
title
parameter inthe script’s
indicator()
or
strategy()
declaration statement. That title is also used whenTradingViewers search for script names.
The name of your script on the chart will be the argument used for the
shorttitle
parameter in the script’s
indicator()
or
strategy()
declaration statement, or the [title]argument in
library()
.
Your script must have a description explaining what your script does and how to use it.
The chart you are using when you publish will become visible in your publication,including any other scripts or drawings on it. Remove unrelated scripts or drawings fromyour chart before publishing your script.
Your script’s code can later be updated. Each update can include
release notes
whichwill appear, dated, under your original description.
Scripts can be liked, shared, commented on or reported by other users.
Your published scripts appear under the “SCRIPTS” tab of your user profile.
A
script widget
and a
script page
are created for your script. The script widget is yourscript’s placeholder showing in script feeds on the platform. It contains your script’stitle, chart and the first few lines of your description. When users click on your script
widget
, the script’s
page
opens. It contains all the information relating to your script.
Visibility
Public
When you publish a public script:
Your script will be inluded in our
Community Scripts
where it becomes visible to themillions of TradingViewers on all internationalized versions of the site.
Your publication must comply with
House Rules
and
Script Publishing Rules
.
If your script is an invite-only script, you must comply with our
Vendor Requirements
.
It becomes accessible through the search functions for scripts.
You will not be able to edit your original description or its title, nor change itspublic/private visibility, nor its access type (open-source, protected, invite-only).
You will not be able to delete your publication.
Private
When you publish a private script:
It will not be visible to other users unless you share its url with them.
It is visible to you from your user profile’s “SCRIPTS” tab.
Private scripts are identifiable by the “X” and “lock” icons in the top-right of theirwidget. The “X” is used to delete it.
It is not moderated, unless you sell access to it or make it available publicly, as it is thenno longer “private”.
You can update its original description and title.
You cannot link to or mentioned it from any public TradingView content (ideas, scriptdescriptions, comments, chats, etc.).
It is not accessible through the search functions for scripts.
Access
Public or private scripts can be published using one of three access types: open, protected orinvite-only. The access type you can select from will vary with the type of account you hold.
Open
The Pine Script™ code of scripts published
open
is visible to all users. Open-source scriptson TradingView use the Mozilla license by default, but you may choose any license you want.You can find information on licensing at
GitHub
.
Protected
The code of
protected
scripts is hidden from view and no one but its author can access it.While the script’s code is not accessible, protected scripts can be used freely by any user.Only accounts with paid plans may publish public protected scripts.
Invite-only
The
invite-only
access type protects both the script’s code and its use. The publisher of aninvite-only script must explicitly grant access to individual users. Invite-only scripts are mostlyused by script vendors providing paid access to their scripts. Only Premium accounts canpublish invite-only scripts, and they must comply with our
Vendor Requirements
.
TradingView does not benefit from script sales. Transactions concerning invite-only scriptsare strictly between users and vendors; they do not involve TradingView.
Public invite-only scripts are the only scripts for which vendors are allowed to ask for paymenton TradingView.
On their invite-only script’s page, authors will see a “Manage Access” button. The “ManageAccess” window allows authors to control who has access to their script.
Preparing a
publication1.
Even if you intend to publish publicly, it is always best to start with a private publicationbecause you can use it to validate what your final publication will look like. You can editthe title, description, code or chart of private publications, and contrary to publicscripts, you can delete private scripts when you don’t need them anymore, so they arethe perfect way to practice before sharing a script publicly. You can read more aboutpreparing script descriptions in the
How We Write and Format Script Descriptions
publication.2.
Prepare your chart. Load your script on the chart and remove other scripts or drawingsthat won’t help users understand your script. Your script’s plots should be easy toidentify on the chart that will be published with it.3.
Load your code in the Pine Editor if it isn’t already. In the Editor, click the “Publish Script”button:4.
A popup appears to remind you that if you publish publicly, it’s important that yourpublication comply with House Rules. Once you’re through the popup, place yourdescription in the field below the script’s title. The default title proposed for yourpublication is the
title
field from your script’s code. It is always best to use that title; itmakes it easier for users to search for your script if it is public. Select the visibility ofyour publication. We want to publish a private publication, so we check the “PrivateScript” checkbox at the bottom-right of the “Publish Script” window:5.
Select the access type you want for your script: Open, Protected or Invite-only. We haveselected “Open” for open-source.6.
Select the appropriate categories for your script (at least one is mandatory) and enteroptional custom tags.7.
Click the “Publish Private Script” button in the lower-right of the window. When thepublication is complete, your published script’s page will appear. You are done! You canconfirm the publication by going to your User Profile and viewing your “SCRIPTS” tab.From there, you will be able to open your script’s page and edit your private publicationby using the “Edit” button in the top-right of your script’s page. Note that you can alsoupdate private publications, just like you can public ones. If you want to share yourprivate publication with a friend, privately send her the url from your script’s page.Remember you are not allowed to share links to private publications in publicTradingView content.
Publishing a
script
Whether you intend to publish privately or publicly, first follow the steps in the previoussection. If you intend to publish privately, you will be done. If you intend to publish publiclyand are satisfied with the preparatory process of validating your private publication, follow thesame steps as above but do not check the “Private Script” checkbox and click the “PublishPublic Script” button at the bottom-right of the “Publish Script” page.
When you publish a new public script, you have a 15-minute window to make changes to yourdescription or delete the publication. After that you will no longer be able to change yourpublication’s title, description, visiblity or access type. If you make an error, send a messageto the
PineCoders
moderator account; they moderate script publications and will help.
Updating a
publication
You can update both public or private script publications. When you update a script, its codemust be different than the previously published version’s code. You can add release noteswith your update. They will appear after your script’s original description in the script’s page.
By default, the chart used when you update will replace the previous chart in your script’spage. You can choose not to update your script page’s chart, however. Note that while youcan update the chart displayed in the script’s page, the chart from the script’s widget will notupdate.
In the same way you can validate a public publication by first publishing a private script, youcan also validate an update on a private publication before proceeding with it on your publicone. The process of updating a published script is the same for public and private scripts.
If you intend to update both the code and chart of your published script, prepare your chartthe same way you would for a new publication. In the following example, we will
not
beupdating the publication’s chart:1.
As you would for a new publication, load your script in the Editor and click the “PublishScript” button.2.
Once in the “Publish Script” window, select the “Update Existing Script” button. Thenselect the script to update from the “Choose script” dropdown menu:3.
Enter your release notes in the text field. The differences in your code are highlightedbelow your release notes.4.
We do not want to update the publication’s chart, so we check the “Don’t update thechart” checkbox:5.
Click the “Publish New Version” button. You’re done.

If you write scripts for your personal use, there is no need to publish them;you can save them in the Pine Editor and use the “Add to Chart” button to add yourscript to your chart.
User Manual / Writing scripts / Limitations
Limitations
Introduction
As is mentioned in our Welcome page:
Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must impose limits in
order to share these resources fairly among our users. We strive to set as few limits as
possible, but will of course have to implement as many as needed for the platform to run
smoothly. Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional symbols,
execution time, memory usage and script size.
If you develop complex scripts using Pine Script™, sooner or later you will run into some of
the limitations we impose. This section provides you with an overview of the limitations that
you may encounter. There are currently no means for Pine Script™ programmers to get data
on the resources consumed by their scripts. We hope this will change in the future.
In the meantime, when you are considering large projects, it is safest to make a proof of
concept in order to assess the probability of your script running into limitations later in your
project.
Below, we describe the limits imposed in the Pine Script™ environment.
Time
Script compilation
Scripts must compile before they are executed on charts. Compilation occurs when you save
a script from the Pine Editor or when you add a script to the chart. A two-minute limit is
imposed on compilation time, which will depend on the size and complexity of your script, and
whether or not a cached version of a previous compilation is available. When a compile
exceeds the two-minute limit, a warning is issued. Heed that warning by shortening your
script because after three consecutives warnings a one-hour ban on compilation attempts is
enforced. The first thing to consider when optimizing code is to avoid repetitions by using
functions to encapsulate oft-used segments, and call functions instead of repeating code.
Script execution
Once a script is compiled it can be executed. See the Events triggering the execution of a
script for a list of the events triggering the execution of a script. The time allotted for the
script to execute on all bars of a dataset varies with account types. The limit is 20 seconds for
basic accounts, 40 for others.
Loop execution
The execution time for any loop on any single bar is limited to 500 milliseconds. The outer
loop of embedded loops counts as one loop, so it will time out first. Keep in mind that even
though a loop may execute under the 500 ms time limit on a given bar, the time it takes to
execute on all the dataset’s bars may nonetheless cause your script to exceed the total
execution time limit. For example, the limit on total execution time will make it impossible for
you script to execute a 400 ms loop on each bar of a 20,000-bar dataset because your script
would then need 8000 seconds to execute.
Chart visuals
Plot limits
A maximum of 64 plot counts are allowed per script. The functions that generate plot counts
are:
plot()
plotarrow()
plotbar()
plotcandle()
plotchar()
plotshape()
alertcondition()
bgcolor()
fill(), but only if its color is of the series form.
The following functions do not generate plot counts:
hline()
line.new()
label.new()
table.new()
box.new()
One function call can generate up to seven plot counts, depending on the function and how it
is called. When your script exceeds the maximum of 64 plot counts, the runtime error
message will display the plot count generated by your script. Once you reach that point, you
can determine how many plot counts a function call generates by commenting it out in a
script. As long as your script still throws an error, you will be able to see how the actual plot
count decreases after you have commented out a line.
The following example shows different function calls and the number of plot counts each one
will generate:
This example generates a plot count of 56. If we were to add two more instances of the last
call to plotcandle(), the script would throw an error stating that the script now uses 70 plot
counts, as each additional call to plotcandle() generates seven plot counts, and 56 + (7 * 2) is
70.
Line, box, polyline, and label limits
Contrary to plots, which can cover the chart’s entire dataset, scripts will only show the last 50
lines, boxes, polylines, and labels on the chart by default. One can increase the maximum
number for each of these drawing types via the max_lines_count , max_boxes_count ,
max_polylines_count , and max_labels_count parameters of the script’s indicator() or
strategy() declaration statement. The maximum number of line, box, and label IDs is 500, and
the maximum number of polyline IDs is 100.
In this example, we set the maximum number of recent labels shown on the chart to 100:
It’s important to note when setting any of a drawing object’s properties to na that its ID still
exists and thus contributes to a script’s drawing totals. To demonstrate this behavior, the
following script draws a “Buy” and “Sell” label on each bar, with x values determined by the
longCondition and shortCondition variables.
The “Buy” label’s x value is na when the bar index is even, and the “Sell” label’s x value is
na when the bar index is odd. Although the max_labels_count is 10 in this example, we can
see that the script displays fewer than 10 labels on the chart since the ones with na values
also count toward the total:
To display the desired number of labels, we must eliminate label drawings we don’t want to
show rather than setting their properties to na. The example below uses an if structure to
conditionally draw the “Buy” and “Sell” labels, preventing the script from creating new label
IDs when it isn’t necessary:
Table limits
Scripts can display a maximum of nine tables on the chart, one for each of the possible
locations: position.bottom_center, position.bottom_left, position.bottom_right,
position.middle_center, position.middle_left, position.middle_right, position.top_center,
position.top_left, and position.top_right. When attempting to place two tables in the same
location, only the newest instance will show on the chart.
`request.*()` calls
Number of calls
A script can use up to 40 unique calls to the functions in the request.*() namespace. A
subsequent call to the same request.*() function with the same arguments is not unique.
This limitation applies when using any request.*() functions, including:
request.security()
request.security_lower_tf()
request.currency_rate()
request.dividends()
request.splits()
request.earnings()
request.quandl()
request.financial()
request.economic()
request.seed()
When a script executes two or more identical request.*() function calls, only the first call
counts toward this limit. The repeated calls do not count because they reuse the data from
the first call rather than executing a redundant request. Note that when a script imports
library functions containing request.*() calls within their scopes, those calls do count
toward this limit, even if the script already calls the same request.*() function with the
same arguments in its main scope.
The script below calls request.security() with the same arguments 50 times within a for loop.
Although the script contains more than 40 request.*() calls, it does not raise an error
because each call is identical. In this case, it reuses the data from the first iteration’s
request.security() call for the repeated calls on all subsequent iterations:
Here, we modified the above script to call request.security() with a different timeframe
argument on each iteration, meaning all 50 calls are now unique. This time, the script will
reach the request.*() call limit while executing the loop and raise a runtime error because it
requests a distinct dataset on each iteration:
Note that:
These example scripts can call request.security() within a loop and allow “series string”
timeframe arguments because we included dynamic_requests = true in the
indicator() declaration statement. See this section of the Other timeframes and data
page for more information.
Intrabars
Scripts can retrieve up to the most recent 200,000 intrabars (lower-timeframe bars) via the
request.security() or request.security_lower_tf() functions, depending on the user’s plan:
All non-professional plans — Basic, Essential, Plus, and Premium — can request up to
100K bars of data.
Expert plans have access to 125K bars of data.
Elite plans get 150K bars of data.
Ultimate plans can request 200K lower timeframe bars.
The request.*() functions limit requested data via the calc_bars_count parameter. If this
parameter is not specified, the default is used, which is 100,000 bars. If the plan permits
more, this limit can be increased by passing a greater value.
The number of bars on the chart’s timeframe covered by 100,000 intrabars varies with the
number of intrabars each chart bar contains. For example, requesting data from the 1-minute
timeframe while running the script on a 60-minute chart means each chart bar can contain up
to 60 intrabars. In this case, the minimum number of chart bars covered by the intrabar
request is 1,666, as 100,000 / 60 = 1,666.67. It’s important to note, however, that a provider
may not report data for every minute within an hour. Therefore, such a request may cover
more chart bars, depending on the available data.
Tuple element limit
All the request.*() function calls in a script taken together cannot return more than 127
tuple elements. When the combined tuple size of all request.*() calls will exceed 127
elements, one can instead utilize user-defined types (UDTs) to request a greater number of
values.
The example below outlines this limitation and the way to work around it. The first
request.security() call represents using a tuple with 128 elements as the expression
argument. Since the number of elements is greater than 127, it would result in an error.
To avoid the error, we can use those same values as fields within an object of a UDT and pass
its ID to the expression instead:
Note that:
This example outlines a scenario where the script tries to evaluate 128 tuple elements in
a single request.security() call. The same limitation applies if we were to split the tuple
request across multiple calls. For example, two request.security() calls that each retrieve
a tuple with 64 elements will also cause an error.
Script size and memory
Compiled tokens
Before the execution of a script, the compiler translates it into a tokenized Intermediate
Language (IL). Using an IL allows Pine Script™ to accommodate larger scripts by applying
various memory and performance optimizations. The compiler determines the size of a script
based on the number of tokens in its IL form, not the number of characters or lines in the
code viewable in the Pine Editor.
The compiled form of each indicator, strategy, and library script is limited to 80,000 tokens.
When a script imports libraries, the total number of tokens from all imported libraries cannot
exceed 1 million. There is no way to inspect a script’s compiled form, nor its IL token count. As
such, you will only know your script exceeds the size limit when the compiler reaches it.
In most cases, a script’s compiled size will likely not reach the limit. However, if a compiled
script does reach the token limit, the most effective ways to decrease compiled tokens are to
reduce repetitive code, encapsulate redundant calls within functions, and utilize libraries
when possible.
It’s important to note that the compilation process omits any unused variables, functions,
types, etc. from the final IL form, where “unused” refers to anything that does not affect the
script’s outputs. This optimization prevents superfluous elements in the code from
contributing to the script’s IL token count.
For example, the script below declares a user-defined type and a user-defined method and
defines a sequence of calls using them:
Despite the inclusion of array.new<myType>(), myType.new() , and arr.m() calls in the
script, the only thing actually output by the script is plot(close) . The rest of the code does
not affect the output. Therefore, the compiled form of this script will have the same number of
tokens as:
Variables per scope
Scripts can contain up to 1,000 variables in each of its scopes. Pine scripts always contain
one global scope, represented by non-indented code, and they may contain zero or more
local scopes. Local scopes are sections of indented code representing procedures executed
within functions and methods, as well as if, switch, for, for…in, and while structures, which
allow for one or more local blocks. Each local block counts as one local scope.
The branches of a conditional expression using the ?: ternary operator do not count as local
blocks.
Scope count
The total number of scopes in a script, including its global scope and each local scope from
the user-defined functions, methods, conditional structures it uses, cannot exceed 550.
It’s important to note that the request.security(), request.security_lower_tf(), and
request.seed() functions duplicate the scopes required to evaluate the values of their
expression argument in another context. The scopes produced by each call to these
request.*() functions also count toward the script’s scope limit.
For example, suppose we created a script with a global variable that depends on the local
scopes of 300 if structures. The total scope count for this script is 301 (1 global scope + 300
local scopes):
Since the total number of scopes is within the limit, it will compile successfully. Now, suppose
we call request.security() to evaluate the value of x from another context and plot its value
as well. In this case, it will effectively double the script’s scope count since the value of x
depends on all the script’s scopes:
We can resolve this issue by encapsulating the if blocks within a user-defined function, as the
scope of a function counts as one embedded scope:
Compilation request size
The size of the compilation request for a script cannot exceed 5MB. The compilation request
is all of the information that is sent to the compiler. This information comprises the script itself
and any libraries the script imports.
Unlike the limit for compiled tokens, the request size limit includes unused parts of code. This
is because the script is not compiled yet, so any unused code has not yet been optimized out.
To reduce the compilation request size, you can:
Reduce the size of the script by optimizing the code.
Reduce the number of script inputs (script inputs are counted separately).
Remove any imported libraries that are not needed.
Use smaller libraries. The entire library is sent for compilation, regardless of which
functions are called.
Collections
Pine Script™ collections (arrays, matrices, and maps) can have a maximum of 100,000
elements. Each key-value pair in a map contains two elements, meaning maps can contain a
maximum of 50,000 key-value pairs.
Other limitations
Maximum bars back
References to past values using the [] history-referencing operator are dependent on the size
of the historical buffer maintained by the Pine Script™ runtime, which is limited to a maximum
of 5000 bars. This Help Center page discusses the historical buffer and how to change its
size using either the max_bars_back parameter or the max_bars_back() function.
Maximum bars forward
When positioning drawings using xloc.bar_index , it is possible to use bar index values
greater than that of the current bar as x coordinates. A maximum of 500 bars in the future can
be referenced.
This example shows how we use the [maxval] parameter in our input.int() function call to cap
the user-defined number of bars forward we draw a projection line so that it never exceeds
the limit:
Chart bars
The number of bars appearing on charts is dependent on the amount of historical data
available for the chart’s symbol and timeframe, and on the type of account you hold. When
the required historical date is available, the minimum number of chart bars is:
40000 historical bars for the Ultimate plan.
30000 historical bars for the Elite plan.
25000 historical bars for the Expert plan.
20000 historical bars for the Premium plan.
10000 historical bars for Essential and Plus plans.
5000 historical bars for other plans.
Trade orders in backtesting
A maximum of 9000 orders can be placed when backtesting strategies. Once that limit is
reached, the earlier orders will be trimmed when new orders are added.
When using Deep Backtesting, the limit is 1,000,000.

Get real OHLC price on a Heikin Ashi chart
Suppose, we have a Heikin Ashi chart (or Renko, Kagi, PriceBreak etc) and we’ve added a Pine
script on it:
You may see that variable c is a Heikin Ashi close price which is not the same as real OHLC
price. Because close built-in variable is always a value that corresponds to a visible bar (or
candle) on the chart.
So, how do we get the real OHLC prices in Pine Script™ code, if current chart type is nonstandard?
We should use request.security function in combination with ticker.new
function. Here is an example:
In a similar way we may get other OHLC prices: open, high and low.
Get non-standard OHLC values on a standard
chart
Backtesting on non-standard chart types (e.g. Heikin Ashi or Renko) is not recommended
because the bars on these kinds of charts do not represent real price movement that you
would encounter while trading. If you want your strategy to enter and exit on real prices but
still use Heikin Ashi-based signals, you can use the same method to get Heikin Ashi values on
a regular candlestick chart:
Plot arrows on the chart
You may use plotshape with style shape.arrowup and shape.arrowdown :
You may use the plotchar function with any unicode character:
Plot a dynamic horizontal line
There is the function hline in Pine Script™, but it is limited to only plot a constant value.
Here is a simple script with a workaround to plot a changing hline:
Plot a vertical line on condition
Access the previous value
Get a 5-days high
Lookback 5 days from the current bar, find the highest bar, plot a star character at that price
level above the current bar
Count bars in a dataset
Get a count of all the bars in the loaded dataset. Might be useful for calculating flexible
lookback periods based on number of bars.
Enumerate bars in a day
Find the highest and lowest values for the entire
dataset
Query the last non-na value

User Manual / FAQ / Alerts
Alerts
How do I make an alert available from my script?
In indicator scripts, there are two ways to define triggers for alerts:
Using the alertcondition() function
Using the alert() function
In strategy scripts, there are also two ways to define alert triggers:
Using the alert() function
Using order fill events
These methods make alert triggers available but do not create alerts directly. Users must
create alerts using a script’s alert triggers by selecting the appropriate trigger in the
“Condition” dropdown of the “Create Alert” dialog box.
Programmers can define multiple alert triggers of one or more types in a script.
How are the types of alerts different?
Usability
Any script can include calls to the alertcondition() and alert() functions within their code.
However, alertcondition() calls have no effect unless the script is an indicator. Libraries can
export functions containing alert() calls, but they cannot issue alert triggers directly.
Order fill alert triggers are available only from strategies.
Options for creating alerts
Each alertcondition() call in an indicator script defines one distinct trigger and one
corresponding option in the “Condition” dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box. If
the user wants multiple alerts, they must create each one separately.
By contrast, if a script includes one or more alert() function calls, only one option appears in
the “Condition” dropdown menu, titled “Any alert() function call”. Selecting this option creates
a single alert that activates based on the occurrences of any executed alert() call.
Similarly, for strategy scripts, the “Order fills and and alert() function calls” or “Order fills only”
option in the “Condition” dropdown menu creates an alert that fires when any order fill event
occurs.
How alerts activate
The alertcondition() function operates exclusively in an indicator’s global scope. Scripts
cannot include calls to this function within any local block, such as the indented code within
an if structure. The function triggers an alert when its specified condition is true . Users
can set the allowed frequency of the alert trigger using the “Frequency” field in the “Create
Alert” dialog box.
The alert() function has no condition parameter. Scripts trigger the alerts on any alert() call
based on each call’s freq argument. Therefore, programmers typically include such calls
within the local scopes of conditional structures to control when they execute.
Order fill alert triggers are available from strategies automatically without requiring extra
code. However, programmers can customize the default alert messages. These alerts fire on
order fill events, which occur when the broker emulator fills a strategy’s orders.
Messages
The message parameter of the alertcondition() function populates the “Message” field of the
“Create Alert” dialog box with a default message, which script users can customize to suit
their alert needs. It accepts a “const string” argument, meaning its value cannot change after
compilation. However, the argument can include placeholders to make the message’s
information dynamic.
The message parameter of the alert() function accepts a “series string” argument, allowing
programmers to create dynamic messages that can include “string” representations of a
script’s calculated values. Unlike alertcondition(), this function does not populate a
“Message” field in the “Create Alert” dialog box, and it does not process placeholders.
Programmers can allow users to customize alert() messages by creating inputs in the script’s
settings.
Order fill alerts have a default message that describes a strategy’s order fill event. This default
message contains strategy-specific placeholders, which the alert replaces with current
strategy information each time it fires. Programmers can override the default message using
the //@strategy_alert_message compiler annotation, which allows text and strategy
placeholders, but not script variables. Script users can edit the default message from the
“Message” field in the “Create Alert” dialog.
The alert_message parameter in a strategy’s order placement commands allows
programmers to define distinct messages for each order fill event. The parameter accepts
“series string” values that can change on each event. To use the values from this parameter in
a strategy’s order fill alerts, include the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder in
the //@strategy_alert_message annotation, or include it in the “Message” field when creating
an alert.
Limitations
The alertcondition() function has some limitations:
Each active alert condition counts toward the total number of alerts the user’s plan
allows.
Every alertcondition() call contributes to the script’s plot count.
Only indicators can issue alert triggers with this function. Other script types do not raise
a compilation error when they include calls to this function in their code, but each call
has no effect.
By contrast, all calls to the alert() function count as one alert, regardless of the number of
calls in the code. In addition, alert() calls do not contribute to a script’s plot count.
Similarly, if a user creates a strategy alert based on order fill events, it counts as one alert,
even though it can fire multiple times with distinct messages from different order executions.
Example `alertcondition()` alert
The script below demonstrates a simple alertcondition() call that triggers alerts when the
current bar’s close is above the value from the previous chart bar. It also uses a plotshape()
call to indicate each bar where the triggerCondition occurred:
See this section of the Alerts page to learn more.
Example `alert()` alert
This example uses the vstop() function from our ta library to calculate a volatility stop value
and trend information based on the Average True Range (ATR). The stopValue trails behind
the chart’s close to form a trend-following system.
The script triggers an alert with an alert() call each time the trend direction changes. The
alert’s message is a “series string” that shows the trend’s new direction and the current stop
value. An additional alert occurs whenever the stopValue moves in the current trend
direction, with a message containing the updated value:
See this section of the Alerts page for more information.
Example strategy alert
This example strategy places a market order with strategy.entry() and a stop-loss and takeprofit
(bracket) order with strategy.exit() when a 5-bar moving average crosses over a 10-bar
moving average. The stop-loss price is 1% below the current close and the take-profit price is
2% above the close. Order fill alerts occur when the broker emulator fills an entry or exit
order. Both order placement commands include unique alert_message arguments that
combine placeholders and “string” representations of the limit and stop values to output
details like the trade action, position size, chart symbol, and order prices:
For more information about order fill events, see this section of the Alerts page. To learn more
about how strategy scripts work, see the Strategies page.
If I change my script, does my alert change?
No, not without creating a new alert.
When a user creates an alert using the “Create Alert” dialog box, that action saves a
“snapshot” of the script, its inputs, and the current chart’s context on TradingView’s servers.
This snapshot acts as an independent copy of the script instance and chart. Therefore, any
changes to the script, its inputs, or the user’s chart do not affect that created alert. To update
an alert after making changes, delete the existing alert and create a new one.
Why aren’t my alerts working?
Here are some common reasons why alerts might not work as expected, and how to solve
them:
Make sure the alert is active and has not expired
Scripts that include alert triggers do not directly create alerts. Users must create alerts in
the “Create Alert” dialog box, where they specify the “Condition” that triggers the alert and
the “Expiration” time. Created alerts do not fire after they expire. See this Help Center
article on Setting up alerts.
Check the alert logs
An alert can fire without a notification, depending on the alert’s settings. Check the logs in
the alert manager to see whether an alert occurred. To set up notifications for an alert, use
the options in the “Notifications” tab of the “Create/Edit Alert” dialog box.
Check for repainting
If an alert fires at a different time than expected, repainting might be the cause. Refer to
the Repainting page for more information.
Limit the frequency of alerts
If more than 15 alerts occur within three minutes, the system automatically halts further
alerts. This frequency limit helps prevent excessive notifications and potential server
overload.
Debug script errors
If a script instance raises a runtime error at some point during its executions, alerts from
that instance cannot fire because the error stops the script from continuing to execute its
code. Some common issues that can halt alerts include:
Attempting to store more than 100,000 elements within a collection
Trying to access an item from a collection at an out-of-bounds index
Referencing historical values of a time series outside its allocated memory buffer
Using loops that take longer than 500 ms to complete their iterations
See this page for additional details about common error messages and troubleshooting
tips.
Why is my alert firing at the wrong time?
Sometimes, alerts may fire when users do not expect according to what their script displays
on the chart. Repainting is the typical cause of such issues.
A chart’s realtime and historical bars often rely on different data feeds. Data providers may
retroactively adjust the reported values on realtime bars, which the displayed data reflects
after users refresh their charts or restart their scripts. Such adjustments can cause
discrepancies where a triggered alert’s timing may not align with the script’s output after
reloading it.
Scripts may also behave differently on historical and realtime bars, which can lead to
repainting. On historical bars, scripts execute once per bar close, whereas on realtime bars,
where alerts fire, scripts execute once for each new tick from the data feed. Therefore, if a
script behaves differently on those bars, users may see differences between its signals and
triggered alerts after reloading the chart.
Below are some common repainting issues that can affect a script’s alerts:
Alerts firing before bar close
Most scripts have fluid data values that update after new ticks during an unconfirmed
realtime bar and finalize after the bar closes. Consequently, an alert that fires on an open
bar may not reflect the final state of the condition after the bar’s confirmation. Set the
alert’s frequency to “Once Per Bar Close” to avoid this issue.
Using `calc_on_every_tick` in strategies
When a strategy script includes calc_on_every_tick = true in its declaration statement
or the user selects the “On every tick” option in the “Recalculate” section of the strategy’s
properties, it recalculates on every price update in the realtime data. This behavior can
cause strategies to repaint because historical bars do not contain the same information as
realtime bars. See this section of the Strategies page to learn more.
Incorrect usage of `request.security()` calls
Using request.security() calls to fetch data from alternative timeframes can cause
discrepancies on historical bars that scripts cannot reproduce on realtime bars. Ensure
you follow the best practices for non-repainting data requests to avoid such discrepancies,
especially with higher-timeframe data. See the Avoiding repainting section of the Other
timeframes and data page and the Higher-timeframe requests publication from PineCoders
for more information.
Can I use variable messages with
alertcondition()?
The message parameter of the alertcondition() function requires a “const string” argument,
which cannot change after compilation. However, the “string” can include placeholders,
which an alert substitutes with corresponding dynamic values from a script each time it fires.
The script below demonstrates two alertcondition() calls whose message arguments include
placeholders for dynamic values. Each time alerts from these triggers occur, the message
displays information about the current chart’s exchange, symbol, price, and volume:
How can I include values that change in my
alerts?
The method for including dynamic values in alert messages varies with the type of alert
trigger:
The alertcondition() function accepts a “const string” message argument that can
contain placeholders for dynamic values. See Can I use variable messages with
`alertcondition()`? for more information.
The alert() function accepts “series string” message arguments, which allows the
convenient creation of dynamic messages that use a script’s calculated values. See this
section for an example.
Order fill alerts can use “series string” values and placeholders. Refer to the example
here.
How can I get custom alerts on many symbols?
To manage alerts across multiple symbols using a custom script, one option is to set an
individual alert on each symbol. There is no automated method to set the same alert across
many symbols simultaneously in a single action. It’s also important to note that the
TradingView screener uses built-in filters and does not support custom Pine Script™ code.
Scripts can retrieve data from other contexts (symbols, timeframes, and modifiers such as
non-standard chart calculations and extended sessions) using the functions in the request.*
() namespace. With these functions, programmers can design scripts that retrieve data from
up to 40 unique contexts. Search for “screener” in the Community scripts for in-depth
examples.
Here is an example incorporating three symbols. The checkForAlert() function calls
request.security() to fetch data from a specified context and evaluate the user-defined
checkForRsiConditions() function using that data. Then, the function calls alert() using the
result to create an alert trigger. The script calls this function three times, creating distinct
alert triggers for each specified symbol:
Note that:
A script can execute up to 40 unique request.*() calls. A request.*() call is not
unique if a script already calls the same function with the same arguments. See this
section of the Limitations page for more information.
This script uses the alert() function because alertcondition() is not allowed within local
scopes.
How can I trigger an alert for only the first instance
of a condition?
Firing an alert only on its first occurrence can help avoid redundant notifications and isolate
specific conditions or state changes, which is beneficial in several use cases. For instance, if a
user relies on alerts to automate order placement, restricting redundant alerts to their first
occurrence can help avoid accidentally placing excessive orders.
For alerts with alertcondition() triggers, setting them to fire once using the “Only Once” option
in the “Create Alert” dialog box is not an optimal solution because it requires manual
reactivation each time an alert occurs. Alerts from the alert() function do not have an “Only
Once” frequency option. The programmer must use conditional logic to ensure the call
executes at the appropriate time.
There are two primary ways to code repeating alerts that fire on only the first instance of a
condition:
Using more strict criteria
Rather than relying on a continuous condition like close > ma , which may remain true
for multiple consecutive bars, try using a more strict condition like ta.crossover(close, ma).
For simple cases, this is the easiest method.
Using state control
More complex scenarios may require controlling and tracking states, which entails setting
flags or specific values to signify certain conditions.
The example script below manages separate bullish and bearish states, and it colors the
background to represent each state. When a bullish or bearish state first occurs, an alert() call
executes and the script plots a triangle on the chart. It also plots smaller triangles to show
where other signals occur within a state, which do not trigger additional alerts:
//
How can I run my alert on a timer or delay?
It is possible to program logic to delay alert triggers so that they occur after the initial
condition. However, because Pine scripts execute on realtime bars only after new price
updates, and an alert only fires when a script executes, it is difficult to predict the exact time
of a delayed alert.
There are no price updates in a closed market, meaning an alert with a delay will not fire until
the market opens again. Similarly, thinly traded securities may have very infrequent price
updates in unpredictable intervals, which can cause a larger delay than intended.
The Pine script below implements a time-delayed alert, which is subject to the limitations
above. When the current close is higher than a moving average, a delay counter starts. After
the delay passes, the alert fires once, and another alert cannot fire until the timer resets.
Users can specify whether the timer resets on each bar using the script’s resetInput :
Note that:
The secondsSince() function from the PineCoders’ time library determines the
duration, in seconds, for which a certain condition remains continuously true . The
duration can be tracked within bars because it uses the varip keyword.
The timing starts when the condition first becomes true . If the condition becomes
false or an optional resetting condition occurs, the timer restarts. If “Reset timing on
new bar” is enabled in the “Settings/Inputs” tab, the function restarts its timing at the
start of a new bar.
A colored label shows what state the script is in:
1. Red - The condition has not occurred yet.
2. Orange - The condition occurred and the delay timer is active.
3. Green - The timer has surpassed the set duration, simulating a delayed alert.
This script relies on variables declared with the varip keyword, which do not revert to their last
committed states during realtime bar calculations. See this section of the User Manual to
learn more about using this keyword. To learn about how rollback works, see the Execution
model page.
How can I create JSON messages in my alerts?
Alerts can send messages containing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to webhooks. Pine
Script™ does not include any built-in functions to produce JSON, but programmers can
create JSON messages in Pine by constructing “string” representations.
When constructing JSON representations, ensure the keys and values intended as strings in
the JSON-formatted text use double quotes, not single quotes.
The following example shows three ways to construct JSON strings in Pine Script™:
1. Static JSON Strings
Define separate alerts with predefined JSON-formatted strings. This method is the
simplest.
2. Placeholders
Use placeholders in the alert message, such as {{close}} and {{volume}} , to add
dynamic values to the JSON. The alert instance replaces the placeholders with
corresponding values when it fires. This method can create richer alerts, especially for
strategies, which have extra placeholders for their calculated values. See this section
above for an example.
3. Dynamic strings
Use the functions in the str.*() namespace and “string” concatenation to create
dynamic JSON-formatted text. This method is the most customizable and advanced.
Our script below shows a simple, straightforward example of this approach. When using
dynamic string formatting to construct JSON strings, ensure the resulting JSON is valid
for all the combined values.
Before using the JSON-formatted string in alerts for real-world applications, such as sending
messages to place orders, test and validate the JSON message to ensure it works as
intended:
Send alerts to an email address to see how the JSON message appears.
Copy the alert message from the email into an online JSON validation tool.
Use an API client application to check the server response to the request.
Refer to this Wikipedia page to learn more about JSON format. To learn more about how alerts
send information using webhooks, see the Help Center article on webhooks.
How can I send alerts to Discord?
Sending alerts from a Pine script to a Discord chat room is possible using webhooks.
The message for Discord communication requires JSON format. The minimum requirement
for a valid message is {"content": "Your message here"} .
The script example below uses placeholders to dynamically populate alert messages with
script values, including the new high or low price, and the chart’s symbol and timeframe:
To send these alert messages to Discord, follow these steps:
1. Create a Discord webhook
Create a new webhook in a server using an account with webhook creation and
management permissions. Refer to Discord’s Intro to Webhooks article for instructions.
Copy the Webhook URL. This URL represents the address where the alert sends a POST
request.
2. Set up an alert on TradingView
Add the above “Discord demo” script to a chart and open the “Create Alert” dialog box.
Choose one of the script’s alert conditions as the “Condition” in the dialog. If you select
the “New High” or “New Low” alerts, choose the “Once Per Bar Close” option in the
“Frequency” field to avoid triggering alerts for new highs or lows on an unconfirmed bar.
When using the “Test” alert, choose “Only Once” as the “Frequency” option.
In the “Notifications” tab of the “Create Alert” dialog, select “Webhook URL” and paste
the URL of the Discord webhook.
3. Test the integration
Check that alerts appear in the alert log on TradingView.
Use the “Test” alert to check whether the webhook works as expected. After the alert
fires, check your Discord to see if it received the message.
If the alert message does not appear in Discord, check whether the pasted webhook
URL is correct.
If the message does not display correctly in Discord, check the JSON format. The
minimum required format is {"content": "Your message here"} .
Consult Discord’s Webhook Resource to learn about advanced JSON message configurations.
For more information about dynamic values in alert messages, refer to How can I include
values that change in my alerts?.
To learn about using JSON format in script alerts, see How can I create JSON messages in my
alerts?.
How can I send alerts to Telegram?
Sending TradingView alerts directly to Telegram is challenging due to protocol differences
and formatting requirements. One solution is to use an intermediary service, which receives
webhook alerts from TradingView, formats them as required by Telegram, and then forwards
them to a Telegram bot.
1. Choose a platform like Zapier, Integromat, or Pipedream. Alternatively, programmers can
consider developing a custom server script using Node.js or Python.
2. In TradingView, set up alerts to send webhook requests to the intermediary service’s
provided URL.
3. Configure the intermediary service to reformat TradingView’s incoming requests for
Telegram’s API and send the formatted message to a Telegram bot using
the sendMessage method.
See the Telegram Bot API documentation for detailed technical information.

What’s the difference between an array declared
with or without `var`?
Using the var keyword, a script can declare an array variable in a script that is initialized only
once, during the first iteration on the first chart bar.
Persistent arrays
When an array is declared with var, it is initialized only once, at the first execution of the
script. This allows the array to retain its contents and potentially grow in size across bars,
making it ideal for cumulative data collection or tracking values over time.
Non-persistent arrays
Arrays declared without var are reinitialized on every new bar, effectively resetting their
content. This behavior suits scenarios where calculations are specific to the current bar, and
historical data retention is unnecessary.
Example script
Here, we initialize two arrays. Array a is declared without using the var keyword, while array
b is declared with var, allowing us to observe and compare their behavior. Throughout the
runtime, we incrementally add an element to each array on each bar. We use a table to
present and compare both the sizes of these arrays and the number of chart bars, effectively
illustrating the impact of different declaration methods on array behavior:
Results
Array A (Non-Persistent): This array is reset at the beginning of each new bar. As a
result, despite adding elements on each bar, its size remains constant, reflecting only
the most recent addition.
Array B (Persistent): This array retains its elements and accumulates new entries
across bars, mirroring the growing count of chart bars. This persistent nature of the
array shows its ability to track or aggregate data over the script’s runtime.
For further details, consult the sections concerning variable declaration modes and their use
in array declarations in the User Manual.
What are queues and stacks?
Scripts can use arrays to create queues and stacks.
Stacks
A stack uses the “last in, first out” (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added item is
the first to be taken away. Think of this like a stack of plates, where you can only place a
new plate on top or remove the top plate. To use an array as a stack, add elements to the
end of the array using array.push() and remove elements from the end of the array using
array.pop().
Queues
A queue uses the “first in, first out” (FIFO) principle, where the first item to be added is the
first to be removed. This kind of queue in code is like a queue in real life, such as in a coffee
shop, where no matter how many people join the end of the queue, the first person still
gets served first. To use an array as a queue, add elements to the end of the array using
array.push() and remove them from the beginning using array.shift().
Stacks are particularly useful for accessing the most recent data, such as for tracking price
levels. Queues are used for sequential data processing tasks, like event handling. Two
example scripts follow, to illustrate these different usages.
Example: Arrays as stacks
This script uses arrays as stacks to manage pivot points. It draws lines from the pivot points
and extends the lines with each new bar until price intersects them. When the script detects a
pivot point, it adds (pushes) a new line to the stack. With each new bar, the script extends the
end point of each line in the stack. It then checks whether price has intersected the high or
low pivot lines at the top of the stack. If so, the script removes (pops) the intersected line
from the stack, meaning that it will no longer be extended with new bars. Note that we do not
need to iterate through the arrays to check all the lines, because price is always between only
the high and low pivot lines at the end of each array.
Example: Arrays as queues
This script uses arrays as queues to track pivot points for monitoring recent support and
resistance levels. It dynamically updates lines extending from the four most recent pivot highs
and lows to the current bar with each new bar. When the script detects a new pivot high or
low, it adds a line that represents this pivot to the respective queue. To maintain the queue’s
size at a constant four items, the script removes the oldest line in the queue whenever it adds
a new line.
For more information on manipulating arrays, see the Arrays section in the User Manual.
How can I perform operations on all elements in an
array?
In Pine Script™, there are no built-in functions to apply operations across the entire array at
once. Instead, scripts need to iterate through the array, performing the operation on each
element one at a time.
The easiest way to retrieve each element in an array is by using a for…in structure. This type
of loop retrieves each element in turn, without the need for specifying the number of
iterations.
The simple form of the loop has the format for element in array , where element is a
variable that is assigned the current array element being accessed.
If the script’s logic requires the position of the element in the array, use the two-argument
form: for [index, element] in array . This form returns both the current element and its
index in a tuple.
Example: retrieving array elements
This first example script uses an array as a queue to store lines representing the latest four
pivot highs and lows. The for…in loop performs two tasks:
It adjusts the x2 endpoint of each line to the current bar_index.
It changes the colors of the lines to blue for support or orange for resistance, based on
their position relative to the close price.
Note that neither of these operations requires knowing the index of the array element.
Example: retrieving array elements and indices
In our second script, we use the two-argument variant of the for…in loop to access elements
and their indices in an array. This method facilitates operations that depend on element
indices, such as managing parallel arrays or incorporating index values into calculations. The
script pairs a boolean array with an array of positive and negative random integers. The
boolean array flags whether each corresponding integer in the primary array is positive.
What’s the most efficient way to search an array?
The obvious way to search for an element in an array is to use a loop to check each element in
turn. However, there are more efficient ways to search, which can be useful in different
situations. Some of the following functions return only the index of a value. Programmers can
then use array.get() if the script needs the actual value.
Checking if a value is present in an array
If all the script needs to do is to check whether a certain value is present in an array or not,
use the array.includes() function. If the element is found, the function returns true; otherwise,
it returns false. This method does not return the index of the element.
The following example script checks if the value 3 is present in the values array, and
displays either “found” or “not found” in a label.
Finding the position of an element
If the script requires the position of an element, programmers can use the array.indexof()
function. This function returns the index of the first occurrence of a value within an array. If
the value is not found, the function returns -1 . This method does not show whether there
are multiple occurrences of the search value in the array. Depending on the script logic, this
method might not be suitable if the array contains values that are not unique.
The following script searches for the first occurrence of 101.2 in the prices array and
displays “found” and the value’s index in a label, or “not found” otherwise.
Binary search
If the script requires the position of the element in a sorted array, the function
array.binary_search() returns the index of a value more efficiently than array.indexof(). The
performance improvement is significant for large arrays. If the value is not found, the function
returns -1 .
This script uses a binary search to find the value 100.5 within an array of prices. The script
displays the original array, the sorted array, the target value (100.5), and the result of the
search. If the value is found, it displays “found”, along with the index of the value. If the value
is not found, it displays “not found”.
If a script does not need the exact value, the functions array.binary_search_leftmost() and
array.binary_search_rightmost() provide an effective way to locate the nearest index to a
given value in sorted arrays. These functions return the index of the value, if it is present. If
the value is not present, they return the index of the element that is closest to the search
value on the left (smaller) or right (larger) side.
How can I debug arrays?
To debug arrays, scripts need to display the contents of the array at certain points in the
script. Techniques that can display the contents of arrays include using plots, labels, tables,
and Pine Logs.
For information about commonly encountered array-related errors, refer to the array Error
Handling section in the User Manual.
Plotting
Using the plot() function to inspect the contents of an array can be helpful because this
function can show numerical values on the script’s status line, the price scale, and the Data
Window. It is also easy to review historical values.
Limitations of this approach include:
Arrays must be of type “float” or “int”.
The number of plots used for debugging counts towards the plot limit for a script.
Plot calls must be in the global scope and scripts cannot call them conditionally.
Therefore, if the size of the array varies across bars, using this technique can be
impractical.
Here we populate an array with the open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices on each bar. The
script retrieves all the elements of the array and plots them on the chart.
Using labels
Using labels to display array values on certain bars is particularly useful for non-continuous
data points or to view all elements of an array simultaneously. Scripts can create labels within
any local scope, including functions and methods. Scripts can also position drawings at any
available chart location, irrespective of the current bar_index. Unlike plots, labels can display
the contents of a variety of array types, including boolean and string arrays.
Limitations of using labels include:
Pine labels display only in the chart pane.
Scripts can display only up to a maximum number of labels.
In the following example script, we monitor the close price at the last four moving average
(MA) crosses in a queued array and use a label to display this array from a local scope
whenever a cross occurs:
For more information, see the debugging with labels section in the User Manual.
Using label tooltips
If programmers want to be able to inspect the values in an array on every bar, displaying the
contents of the array in a label is not convenient, because the labels overlap and become
difficult to read. In this case, displaying the array contents in a label tooltip can be visually
clearer. This method has the same advantages and limitations as using labels in the section
above.
This example script plots a fast and a slow moving average (MA). It maintains one array of the
most recent three values of the fast MA, and one array for the slow MA. The script prints
empty labels on each bar. The tooltip shows the values of the MA arrays and whether or not
the MAs crossed this bar. The labels are displayed in a semi-transparent color, and the tooltip
is visible only when the cursor hovers over the label.
Using tables
Using tables for debugging offers a more organized and scalable alternative to labels. Tables
can display multiple “series” strings in a clear format that remains unaffected by the chart’s
scale or the index of the bars.
Limitations of using tables for debugging include that, unlike labels, the state of a table can
only be viewed from the most recent script execution, making it hard to view historical data.
Additionally, tables are computationally more expensive than other debugging methods and
can require more code.
In the following example script, we create and display two unrelated arrays, to show how
flexible this approach can be. The first array captures the times of the last six bars where a
Golden Cross occurred. The second array records the last eight bar indices where the
Relative Strength Index (RSI) reached new all-time highs within the chart’s history. We use the
whenSince() function from the PineCoders’ getSeries library to create and update the arrays.
This function treats the arrays as queues, and limits their size.
Using Pine Logs
Pine Logs are messages that display in the Pine Logs pane, along with a timestamp when the
logging function was called. Scripts can create log messages at specific points during the
execution of a script. Pine Logs can display any script values or variables at any part of your
code, including local scopes, functions, and loops.
By logging messages to the console whenever there is a modification to the array,
programmers can track the logical flow of array operations in much more detail than by using
other approaches.
The script below updates a previous example script from the section on queues and stacks to
add logging. It uses arrays as stacks to track lines drawn from pivot points. When a pivot
occurs, the script adds a new line to the stack and continues to extend the lines on each bar
until an intersection with price occurs. If an intersection is found, the script removes (pops)
the intersected line from the stack, meaning it will no longer be extended with new bars.
The console messages are time stamped and offer detailed information about when elements
are added to and removed from the arrays, the current size of the arrays, and the specific
prices at which elements were added.
Can I use matrices or multidimensional arrays in
Pine Script™?
Pine Script™ does not directly support multidimensional arrays; however, it provides matrices
and user-defined types (UDTs). Programmers can use these data structures to create and
manipulate complex datasets.
Matrices
Pine Script matrices are like two-dimensional arrays. They organize data in a rectangular
grid, facilitating operations like transformations, linear algebra, and other complex
calculations. They are particularly useful for quantitative modeling, such as portfolio
optimization, correlation matrix analysis, and more. Just as in arrays, all elements in a
matrix must be of the same type, which can be a built-in or a user-defined type. Pine
Script™ provides a range of functions for manipulating and performing calculations on
matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.
Using UDTs for multidimensional structures
Programmers can achieve similar functionality to multidimensional arrays through defining
user-defined types (UDTs). For example, a script can define a UDT that includes an array
as one of its fields. UDTs themselves can be contained in arrays. In this way, scripts can
effectively have arrays of arrays.
For more information, see the sections on Matrices, Maps, and Objects in the User Manual.
How can I debug objects?
To debug objects, create custom functions that break down an object into its constituent
fields and convert these fields into strings. See the Debugging section of the User Manual for
information about methods to display debug information. In particular, Pine Logs can display
extensive and detailed debug information. See the FAQ section about debugging arrays using
Pine Logs for an explanation of using logs for debugging.
In our example script, we create a user-defined type (UDT) named openLine , which includes
fields such as price , openTime , and a line object called level . On the first bar of each
session, the script initializes a new openLine instance. This object tracks the session’s
opening price and time, and it draws a line at the open price, extending from the session’s
start to its close. An array stores each openLine object. A custom function debugOpenLine()
breaks an openLine object into its individual fields, converts the fields to strings, and then
logs a message that displays these strings in the console.

User Manual / FAQ / Functions
Functions
Can I use a variable length in functions?
Many built-in technical analysis (TA) functions have a length parameter, such as
ta.sma(source, length) . A majority of these functions can process “series” lengths, i.e.,
lengths that can change from bar to bar. Some functions, however, only accept “simple”
integer lengths, which must be known on bar zero and not change during the execution of the
script.
Check the Reference Manual entry for a function to see what type of values a function can
process.
Additional resources
For more advanced versions of functions that support “series” lengths, or for extra
technical analysis tools explore the ta library on the TradingView profile. This library offers
a range of extended TA-related capabilities and custom implementations.
User-defined functions
For built-in functions that do not accept “series” lengths and for which the functionality is
not available in the ta library, consider creating a user-defined function.
How can I calculate values depending on variable
lengths that reset on a condition?
To calculate certain values that are dependent on varying lengths, which also reset under
specific conditions, the ta.barssince() function can be useful. This function counts the
number of bars since the last occurrence of a specified condition, automatically resetting the
count each time this condition is met. There are, however, some considerations to take into
account when using this function for this purpose.
Firstly, before the condition is met for the first time in a chart’s history, ta.barssince() returns
na. This value is not usable as a length for functions and can cause errors, especially during
execution on a chart’s early bars. For a more robust version, use nz() to replace the na return
of ta.barssince() with zero for early bars.
Secondly, when the condition is met, ta.barssince() returns zero for that bar, since zero bars
have elapsed since the condition was last true.
Since lengths cannot be zero, it is necessary to add one to a returned value of zero, ensuring
that the length is always at least one.
Here’s an example of how to use these principles for a practical purpose. The following
example script calculates the highest and lowest price points since the start of a new day. We
use timeframe.change() to detect the start of a new day, which is our condition. The
ta.barssince() function calculates the number of bars that elapsed since this condition was
last met. The script passes this number, or “lookback”, to the ta.lowest() and ta.highest()
functions, which determine the highest and lowest points since the start of the new day:
How can I round a number to x increments?
Rounding numbers to specific increments is useful for tasks like calculating levels for grid
trading, dealing with fractional shares, or aligning trading parameters to specific pip values.
In this example, the roundToIncrement() function accepts a value and an increment as
parameters. It divides the value by the increment, rounds the result, then multiplies it by the
increment to give the rounded value. To demonstrate the function, the closing price is
rounded to the nearest increment defined in the user menu:
How can I control the precision of values my script
displays?
The precision and format arguments in the indicator() or strategy() declaration statement
control the number of decimals in the values that a script displays.
By default, scripts use the precision of the price scale. To display more decimal places,
specify a precision argument that exceeds the value of the current price scale.
How can I control the precision of values used in my
calculations?
The math.round(number, precision) variation of the math.round() function rounds values
according to a specified precision. Alternatively, the math.round_to_mintick() function rounds
values to the nearest tick precision of the chart’s symbol.
How can I round to ticks?
To round values to the tick precision of a chart’s symbol, use the function
math.round_to_mintick(). To convert the resulting number to a string, use
str.tostring(myValue, format.mintick) to first round the number to tick precision and then
return its string representation, where myValue is the number to convert into a rounded
string.
How can I abbreviate large values?
There are different ways to abbreviate large numerical values, such as volume. For instance,
the number 1,222,333.0 can be simplified to 1.222M. Here are some methods to accomplish
this:
Apply a global setting
Use the argument format = format.volume within either the indicator() or strategy()
statements. Using this setting, displays all values in the script in their abbreviated forms.
Abbreviate specific values
To abbreviate only certain values for string display, use the str.tostring(value,
format.volume) function.
Use a custom function
To specify a custom precision or abbreviate values up to trillions, use a custom function. In
the following example script, the user-defined function abbreviateValue() divides the
value by a power of ten based on its magnitude, and adds an abbreviation letter (K, M, B,
or T) to represent the magnitude of the original value. The function also adds a subtle
space between the value and the magnitude letter. The print() function displays the
value on the chart for visualization.
How can I calculate using pips?
Use the custom function calcBaseUnit() in the following example script to return the correct
pip value for Forex symbols, or the base unit of change for non-forex symbols:
How do I calculate averages?
The method of calculating averages depends on the type of values to average.
Distinct variables
To find the average of a small number of discrete variables, use the function
math.avg(number0, number1, …). Simply pass each of the variables as an argument to this
function.
Bar prices
To find the average price of a single bar, use the built-in variables hl2, hlc3, and ohlc4.
Series values
To compute the average of the last n values in a series, use the function ta.sma(series,n).
Custom datasets
To average a custom set of values, organize them into an array and use array.avg(). For
complex datasets, programmers can use the matrix.avg() function to average the contents
of a matrix. For a deeper understanding of averaging custom datasets, refer to this
conditional averages publication.
How can I calculate an average only when a certain
condition is true?
The usual methods of calculating averages, which were discussed in the calculating averages
section above, apply across all data points in a range. To calculate averages of only those
values that occur under specific conditions, calculate conditional averages using custom
functions.
The example script below imports a library called ConditionalAverages and uses two of its
functions:
The avgWhen() function calculates the average volume of session opening bars across
the entire dataset.
The avgWhenLast() function averages the opening volumes for the last five session
opening bars.
The condition for these conditional averages is session opening bars, which we determine
using the session.isfirstbar_regular variable.
How can I generate a random number?
Use the math.random() function to generate random numbers. This example script creates a
circle plot with random RGB color values and a random y value between 0 and 1:
How can I evaluate a filter I am planning to use?
To evaluate a filter, insert your filter code into the Filter Information Box - PineCoders FAQ
script. This script conducts an impulse response analysis and shows the filter’s
characteristics in a label on the chart.
For further details and a guide on integrating your filter into the code, refer to the publication’s
description.
What does nz() do?
The nz() function replaces any na values with zero, or with a user-defined value if the
replacement argument is specified. This function helps to prevent na values from interfering
with calculations.
The following example script shows an exaggerated failure as a result of a single na value. The
barRangeRaw variable is na only once, on the first bar, because it references a bar that does
not exist, using the history-referencing operator. The alternative variable barRangeWithNz
uses nz() to prevent an na value from ever occurring.
The dependentCalculation variable takes one of these values and uses it to calculate a crude
average of the bar range. If the input to this calculation is ever na, the series will be na forever
after that.
Choose between the two values for bar range using the input setting, and the range either
displays or not. In the latter case, the Data Window shows that the value of
dependentCalculation is ϴ , meaning na.
The nz() function is also useful to protect against any potential divide-by-zero errors. It
guarantees a return value even when an equation unintentionally features a zero in the
denominator. Consider the following code snippet that intentionally creates a divide-by-zero
scenario by setting the denominator to zero. Without the nz() function, this expression would
return na, instead of zero:

User Manual / FAQ / Indicators
Indicators
Can I create an indicator that plots like the built-in
Volume or Volume Profile indicators?
The Volume and Visible Range Volume Profile indicators (along with some other built-in
indicators) are written in Java. They display data on the main chart pane in a unique way:
The bars are anchored to the bottom or right edge of the chart, not to an absolute x or y
value.
The length of the bars is a relative percentage of the available space and is not an
absolute price or number of bars.
The length of the bars adjusts automatically according to the data from the range of
bars that are visible on the chart. The lengths of the bars are normalized so as never to
appear too small or too large.
The width of the bars adjusts automatically to fit the visible space.
It is difficult for Pine Script™ indicators to plot values in the same way.
Limitations of `plot.style_columns`
Volume, or another series, plotted as columns, is anchored to the bottom of the chart, and
the width and length of the bars can adjust dynamically. However, the tops of the bars are
defined by absolute price values. This means that it is not possible for the series to be
plotted on the main chart without distorting the price scale. Also, plots must be defined
during processing of the bar they are plotted on, and cannot be plotted retroactively.
Limitations of drawings
Drawing objects such as lines and boxes are anchored to an absolute price scale, not to the
edge of the chart. Drawing objects do not adjust their length automatically. Lines do not
adjust their width automatically. Although boxes can be drawn exactly one bar wide, and so
adjust their width automatically, they cannot be drawn so as to fit exactly in one bar; they
always draw from the middle of one bar to the middle of another.
The following example script demonstrates some techniques for approximating the way that
the built-in Volume indicator displays.
We use the chart.right_visible_bar_time and chart.left_visible_bar_time built-in
variables, through the PineCoders’ VisibleChart library, to define the bars that are
visible. Then we calculate the highest and lowest price, and the highest volume, for that
period.
We plot lines retroactively, after the visible window and all related values are known.
We anchor the lines below the lowest visible price, so that it looks as if they are
anchored to the bottom edge of the chart.
We scale the length of all the volume bars so that the longest bar in the set is
approximately 30% of the screen height, similar to the built-in Volume indicator.
We adjust the width of the lines depending on how many bars are visible.
This script has some other limitations:
The lines do not begin from the bottom of the chart if other indicators display plots or
drawings below that level.
In common with any script that uses the chart.right_visible_bar_time or
chart.left_visible_bar_time built-in variables, the script must refresh each time the chart
is moved or a new bar appears.
There is a maximum limit of 500 lines per script.
The width of the lines is calculated based on how many bars are visible. However, a Pine
script has no way of knowing how much blank space there is to the right of the final bar.
If the user scrolls to the right, the lines can appear too wide and overlap each other.
Can I use a Pine script with the TradingView
screener?
The TradingView screener uses only its built-in filters, and cannot use a Pine script. Search for
“screener” in the Community Collection to find scripts that use the request.security() function
to screen pre-set lists of symbols.
See also this FAQ entry for an example script that generates alerts on multiple symbols. Note
that using several request.security() calls can cause scripts compile and run more slowly
than expected.
How can I use the output from one script as input to
another?
Scripts with an input of type input.source() can take a plot from another script (up to a
maximum of ten) as an input. Select the script and plot to take as input in the script’s
“Settings” tab. If the user removes the script from the chart and adds it again, they must
select the correct inputs again.
The sources used as external inputs must originate from indicators; they cannot originate
from strategies. However, plots originating from indicators can be used in strategies.
For further information, refer to this blog post and the Source input section in the User
Manual.
Can my script draw on the main chart when it’s
running in a separate pane?
Scripts that have the overlay parameter in the indicator() or strategy() functions set to
false appear in a separate pane to the main chart. Such scripts can affect the display of the
main chart in only two ways:
Changing bar colors, using the barcolor() function.
Forcing plots to overlay, using force_overlay = true in the plotting function. The
force_overlay parameter is available in most functions that draw on the chart.
Is it possible to export indicator data to a file?
The option “Export chart data…” in the dropdown menu at the top right corner of the chart
exports a comma-separated values (CSV) file that includes time, OHLC data, and any plots
generated by your script. This option can also export strategy data.
To include specific information in the CSV file, ensure that it is plotted by the script. If this
extra information is far from the symbol’s price and the existing indicator plots, and plotting it
on the chart could distort the scale of the script, or if you prefer not to display certain plots,
consider using the display parameter in the plot() function.
Here is an example plot that displays the close only in the Data Window. The plot title “No
chart display” becomes the column header for this value in the CSV file.
Alternatively, the “Scale price chart only” in the chart settings maintains the script’s scale. To
access these settings, right-click on the chart’s price scale.
To determine if a condition is true or false, use the plotshape() function, which records a 1 (for
true) or 0 (for false) in the CSV file.

User Manual / FAQ / Other data and timeframes
Other data and timeframes
What kinds of data can I get from a higher
timeframe?
Generally speaking, the request.security() function can get the same kinds of data from
another timeframe that is available on the chart timeframe. Scripts can retrieve built-in
variables like open, high, low, close, volume, and bar_index.
The request.security() function can also evaluate built-in or user-defined functions in the
requested context (timeframe and symbol). For example, the following example script
retrieves the Average True Range (ATR) value from the daily ( 1D ) timeframe by passing the
ta.atr() function as the expression argument.
Which `security.*` function should I use for lower
timeframes?
The request.security() function is intended for accessing data at timeframes that are equal to
or higher than the chart’s current timeframe. It is possible to retrieve data from lower
timeframes (LTF) using this function. However, the function returns the value from only one
LTF bar within the chart’s current bar (the last bar, by default).
If the script supplies the expression as a variable or simple calculation, directly or within a
function, the data that request.security() returns from a lower timeframe is generally of limited
use (see the first script in this section for an example). It is possible, however, to construct a
function that performs meaningful calculations on the LTF bars and then returns the result on
the last bar. The following example script counts the number of LTF bars in a chart bar and
returns this value on the last LTF bar. For simplicity, the timeframes are hardcoded to "1D"
and "1W" and the script should therefore be run from a chart on the weekly timeframe.
When using the request.security() function on a lower timeframe, all calculations that
reference individual LTF bars must be done within the requested context, and only the result
of the calculation is returned. Using the request.security_lower_tf() function for intrabar
analysis is usually easier and more powerful, because it returns an array of data from all
available intrabars within a chart bar. Returning the data for each bar allows scripts to perform
calculations on specific bars or all bars in the main script context.
In the following version of our example script, we use request.security_lower_tf() to perform
the same calculations. With this approach, we do not need to explicitly define the current
chart’s timeframe, nor do we need a custom function.
See the sections in the User Manual page “Other timeframes and Data” about
request.security_lower_tf() and using request.security() on lower timeframes to learn
more about the differences between running these functions on a lower timeframe.
How to avoid repainting when using the
`request.security()` function?
Repainting can be a problem when retrieving data from higher or lower timeframes using
request.security().
Retrieving data from a different symbol on the chart’s timeframe does not risk repainting.
Requesting data from the chart’s own symbol and timeframe does not result in repainting
either, but it is usually unnecessary to use request.security() rather than simply referencing
the chart’s own values (except when modifying the chart’s ticker using ticker.*()
functions). When using the chart’s timeframe, there is no need to offset the data, change the
default lookahead value, or use barmerge.lookahead_on in order to avoid repainting.
Higher timeframes
Values from a higher timeframe (HTF) often repaint because a historical bar on the chart
might include data from a realtime bar on the HTF. Realtime values can change throughout
the bar; for example, the close price reflects the latest price update in a realtime bar. When
the HTF bar closes and its values become fixed, the relevant historical chart bars change to
adjust to the fixed HTF values. This behavior is described in the Historical and realtime
behavior section of the User Manual. Users expect historical bars not to change, which is one
reason why repainting is such a concern.
To prevent repainting, use confirmed values that remain consistent across all bars. The most
robust method is to offset all expressions by 1. For example, instead of close , which is
equivalent to close[0] , use close[1] . The request.security() call must also use
barmerge.lookahead_on. This method returns data that is up to one HTF bar “late”, and is
thus not subject to change.
The following example script demonstrates the use of a single bar offset to the expression
argument and barmerge.lookahead_on in request.security() to ensure that the data behaves
the same on historical and realtime bars. The script triggers a runtime error if the chart’s
timeframe exceeds or matches the daily timeframe, to prevent the return of inaccurate values.
See the Avoiding repainting section of the User Manual for more information.
Lower timeframes
Although the request.security() function is intended to operate on timeframes greater than or
equal to the chart timeframe, it can request data from a lower timeframe (LTF), with
limitations. When accessing data from a LTF, the function evaluates the given expression in
the LTF context and returns the result from a single LTF bar per chart bar. The specific LTF bar
returned depends on the lookahead parameter:
barmerge.lookahead_on returns the first intrabar of the period historically, but the last
intrabar in realtime.
barmerge.lookahead_off always returns the last intrabar for both historical and realtime
data. To prevent repainting (in this case, inconsistent results between realtime and
historical data) use barmerge.lookahead_off for lower timeframe data requests.
In most cases, using the request.security_lower_tf() function is more suitable for lower
timeframes, as it returns an array containing data from all available intrabars within a chart
bar. See the section on request.security_lower_tf() to learn more.
How can I convert the chart’s timeframe into a
numeric format?
The timeframe.in_seconds() function converts a timeframe specified in timeframe.period
format into an equivalent number of seconds. Having the timeframe in a numeric format
means that scripts can calculate the number of time units within a specific timeframe, or
perform operations that adjust the timeframe used in HTF calls in relation to the chart’s
timeframe, as described in this FAQ entry.
In this script example, we use the timeframe.in_seconds() function to determine the chart’s
timeframe, measured in seconds. Since no specific timeframe argument is specified, the
function defaults to using timeframe.period , which returns the chart’s current timeframe.
The script then converts the timeframe in seconds into various other units of time, including
minutes, hours, and days, and displays the original string and converted numeric values in a
table:
How can I convert a timeframe in “float” minutes
into a string usable with `request.security()`?
The built-in function timeframe.from_seconds() function converts a number of seconds into a
timeframe string that is compatible with request.security().
The example script below converts a user-defined number of minutes into a timeframe string
using the timeframe.from_seconds() function. The script then requests the close price from
that timeframe using request.security() and plots it. Additionally, we display the resulting
timeframe string in a table on the chart’s top right corner:
How do I define a higher timeframe that is a multiple
of the chart timeframe?
This example script uses the timeframe.in_seconds() and timeframe.from_seconds()
functions to calculate a higher timeframe that is a fixed multiple of the chart’s current
timeframe. Using the input for the multiplier, the user can define the ratio between the chart’s
timeframe and the higher timeframe. The script then calculates the Relative Strength Index
(RSI) for both the chart’s timeframe and the higher timeframe, plotting both in a separate
pane for comparison. We display the calculated higher timeframe string in a table on the main
chart pane by using force_overlay :
How can I plot a moving average only when the
chart’s timeframe is 1D or higher?
To plot a moving average on a chart only if it has a timeframe of daily (“1D”) or higher, scripts
can use the timeframe.in_seconds() function to convert the chart’s current timeframe into
seconds. Since a day consists of 86400 seconds, any timeframe equal to or exceeding this
value corresponds to a daily or longer duration.
The example script below calculates and plots a Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the closing
prices over the last 200 bars. The script uses a ternary operator to return the moving average
on timeframes of 1D or greater, or na if the timeframe is shorter than one day. Because plot()
calls cannot be in a local scope, scripts cannot conditionally call this function. Passing an na
value as the series argument is an effective way to not plot anything. Note that plotting an
na value does count towards the script’s plot limit.
What happens if I plot a moving average from the 1H
timeframe on a different timeframe?
The request.security() function can access data from a different context, such as a different
symbol or timeframe. There are different considerations when accessing data from a
timeframe higher or lower than the chart timeframe.
First, let’s consider an example of plotting data from a lower timeframe. The following script
plots a 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) derived from the 1-hour (1H) timeframe
on any chart, irrespective of the timeframe of that chart:
Assuming that we run this script on a chart with a daily timeframe, we encounter the following
problems:
For each daily bar, the chart can plot only 1 of the 24 MA values theoretically available.
The plot misses out the intraday fluctuations and trends that a 1H moving average (MA)
is typically used to identify.
The script above displays only the EMA value calculated for the final 1-hour bar of each
day. In realtime, the plot displays the most recently known value.
Unlike request.security(), the request.security_lower_tf() function is intended for use on lower
timeframes. It returns an array containing data from all available intrabars within a chart bar.
See this section of the User Manual to learn more.
We could rewrite the script to use request.security_lower_tf(), but plotting a moving average
from a lower timeframe is still not very practical.
A more logical approach is to plot MAs from a higher timeframe. This strategy shows broader
market trends within the context of shorter-term price movements. For example, plotting a
daily MA on a 1H chart provides insights into how intraday prices are trending relative to the
longer-term daily average.
In the following example script, we plot the 21 EMA calculated at the 1H timeframe, but only
when the chart’s timeframe is equal to or lower than 1H. We call the request.security()
function in the recommended way to avoid repainting.
Why do intraday price and volume values differ from
values retrieved with `request.security()` at daily
timeframes and higher?
Intraday open, high, low, close, and volume (OHLCV) values can be different from those from
request.security() at daily timeframes and higher for a number of reasons, including the
following:
Different data feeds: Certain trades (like block trades and OTC trades, especially in
stocks) are recorded only at the end of the trading day, so their volume affects the Endof-
Day (EOD) feed but not the intraday feed.
Price discrepancies: There can be slight differences in prices between EOD and
intraday data. For example, an EOD high might not match any intraday highs due to
variations in data feeds.
Extended hours data: EOD data feeds do not include information from trading outside
regular hours, unlike some intraday feeds. For instance, the bars of an hourly chart
might straddle the open of a session, mixing data from pre-market and regular trading.
For an extended list of factors with detailed explanations, refer to the Data feeds section in
the User Manual.

What does “scope” mean?
The scope of a variable is the part of a script that defines the variable and in which it can be
referenced. There are two main types of scope: global and local.
Global Scope: The global scope is all of the script that is not inside a function, if
statement, or other conditional structure. Code from anywhere in the script can access
global variables. There is only one global scope.
Local Scope: Code that is inside a function or in any local block (one that is inset by four
spaces) defines a local scope. Only code that is in the same local scope can access a local
variable. There can be many local scopes.
The following example script gives an “Undeclared identifier” error when we try to access a
local variable from the global scope.
To fix this error, we can declare the variable in the global scope, thus making it accessible
from any scope in the script, and then conditionally modify it within a local block:
Similarly, the following script gives an “Undeclared identifier” error when we try to access a
variable defined in one local scope from another local scope. In this case, local scope 1
contains local scope 2, but the same problem would be present if they were on the same
level. When a scope contains another one, the inner scope can access variables declared in
the outer one, but not vice versa.
For more information about scopes, see the Code section of the User Manual.
How can I convert a script to a newer version of Pine
Script™?
See the Migration Guides section of the User Manual for instructions about upgrading the
version of Pine that a script uses.
Can I access the source code of “Invite-Only” or
“closed-source” scripts?
No; only open scripts have their source code visible. The source code of protected and Invite-
Only scripts is hidden and can only be seen by the script author.
For a definition of the access types of published scripts: open, protected, and Invite-Only, see
this article in the Help Center.
For an explanation on the visibility (public/private) that a script can have, see the Visibility
section of the Publishing scripts page in the User Manual.
Is Pine Script™ an object-oriented language?
Although Pine Script™ is not strictly an object-oriented programming language, it
incorporates some object-oriented features, notably user-defined types (UDTs). Scripts can
create objects as instances of a UDT. These objects have one or more fields, which can store
values of various data types.
Here is a simple example of how to use the type keyword to create an object:
In this example, we create an object newPivot , which is an instance of the user-defined type
pivot . The script then plots the y field of newPivot .
How can I access the source code of built-in
indicators?
There are two ways to access the source code of built-in indicators that are written in Pine:
Create a new indicator
In the Pine Script™ Editor, click the “Open” menu and choose the “Built-in script” option.
Select the built-in indicator that you want to work with.
Edit the code
With the indicator displayed on the chart, click on the curly braces {} next to the indicator
name to open it in the Pine Editor. To edit the code, click the option to create a working
copy.
Some built-in indicators, such as the Volume Profile or chart pattern indicators, are not written
in Pine and so the code for these indicators is not accessible. These indicators are not
included in the “Built-in script” menu, and curly braces are not displayed next to their names
on the chart.
How can I examine the value of a string in my
script?
Scripts can print strings to Pine Logs on any or every bar, along with messages about the
logic of the script at that point. See the Pine Logs section of the User Manual for information
about logging.
Scripts can also display string in labels or label tooltips. The following example scripts
displays a string in a label on the last bar of the chart using a custom function.
For more techniques, see the debugging strings section of the User Manual.
How can I visualize my script’s conditions?
If a script contains complex logical conditions, it can be difficult to debug the output.
Visualizing each condition separately can help to debug any problems. See the Compound
and nested conditions section of the User Manual for an example.
How can I make the console appear in the editor?
To display the console in the editor, either press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + ` (grave accent),
or right-click within the editor and choose the “Toggle Console” option.
How can I plot numeric values so that they don’t
affect the indicator’s scale?
Plotting numerical values on the main chart pane can distort the price scale if the values differ
too much from the price.
One way around this is not to plot the values on the chart, but use the Data Window to inspect
them. Add display = display.data_window to the plot() call, and the values are visible in the
Data Window for any single historical or realtime bar that the cursor hovers over.
Another option is to set the script to display in a separate pane by using overlay = false in
the indicator() declaration. The user needs to delete and re-add the script to the chart if this
parameter is changed. Plot the numeric values to track in the separate pane, and draw the
rest of the script visuals on the main chart pane by using the force_overlay parameter.
Additionally, right-clicking on the scale on the chart brings out the dropdown menu. The
“Scale Price Chart Only” option there makes it so the Auto mode of the chart scale only takes
the chart itself into account, without adjusting for plots or other graphics of all indicators that
overlay that chart.

User Manual / Error messages
Error messages
The if statement is too long
This error occurs when the indented code inside an if statement is too large for the compiler.
Because of how the compiler works, you won’t receive a message telling you exactly how
many lines of code you are over the limit. The only solution now is to break up your if
statement into smaller parts (functions or smaller if statements). The example below shows a
reasonably lengthy if statement; theoretically, this would throw line 4: if statement is too
long :
To fix this code, you could move these lines into their own function:
Script requesting too many securities
The maximum number of securities in script is limited to 40. If you declare a variable as a
request.security function call and then use that variable as input for other variables and
calculations, it will not result in multiple request.security calls. But if you will declare a
function that calls request.security --- every call to this function will count as a
request.security call.
It is not easy to say how many securities will be called looking at the source code. Following
example have exactly 3 calls to request.security after compilation:
Script could not be translated from: null
Usually this error occurs in version 1 Pine scripts, and means that code is incorrect. Pine
Script™ of version 2 (and higher) is better at explaining errors of this kind. So you can try to
switch to version 2 by adding a special attribute in the first line. You’ll get line 2: no viable
alternative at character '$' :
line 2: no viable alternative at character ’$’
This error message gives a hint on what is wrong. $ stands in place of string with script title.
For example:
Mismatched input <…> expecting <???>
Same as no viable alternative , but it is known what should be at that place. Example:
line 3: mismatched input 'plot' expecting 'end of line without line continuation'
To fix this you should start line with plot on a new line without an indent:
Loop is too long (> 500 ms)
We limit the computation time of loop on every historical bar and realtime tick to protect our
servers from infinite or very long loops. This limit also fail-fast indicators that will take too long
to compute. For example, if you’ll have 5000 bars, and indicator takes 500 milliseconds to
compute on each of bars, it would have result in more than 16 minutes of loading:
It might be possible to optimize algorithm to overcome this error. In this case, algorithm may
be optimized like this:
Script has too many local variables
This error appears if the script is too large to be compiled. A statement var=expression
creates a local variable for var . Apart from this, it is important to note, that auxiliary variables
can be implicitly created during the process of a script compilation. The limit applies to
variables created both explicitly and implicitly. The limitation of 1000 variables is applied to
each function individually. In fact, the code placed in a global scope of a script also implicitly
wrapped up into the main function and the limit of 1000 variables becomes applicable to it.
There are few refactorings you can try to avoid this issue:
can be converted into:
Pine Script™ cannot determine the referencing
length of a series. Try using max_bars_back in the
indicator or strategy function
The error appears in cases where Pine Script™ wrongly autodetects the required maximum
length of series used in a script. This happens when a script’s flow of execution does not
allow Pine Script™ to inspect the use of series in branches of conditional statements ( if ,
iff or ? ), and Pine Script™ cannot automatically detect how far back the series is
referenced. Here is an example of a script causing this problem:
In order to help Pine Script™ with detection, you should add the max_bars_back parameter to
the script’s indicator or strategy function:
You may also resolve the issue by taking the problematic expression out of the conditional
branch, in which case the max_bars_back parameter is not required:
In cases where the problem is caused by a variable rather than a built-in function ( vwma in
our example), you may use the max_bars_back function to explicitly define the referencing
length for that variable only. This has the advantage of requiring less runtime resources, but
entails that you identify the problematic variable, e.g., variable s in the following example:
This situation can be resolved using the max_bars_back function to define the referencing
length of variable s only, rather than for all the script’s variables:
When using drawings that refer to previous bars through bar_index[n] and xloc =
xloc.bar_index , the time series received from this bar will be used to position the drawings
on the time axis. Therefore, if it is impossible to determine the correct size of the buffer, this
error may occur. To avoid this, you need to use max_bars_back(time, n) . This behavior is
described in more detail in the section about drawings.
Memory limits exceeded. The study allocates X
times more than allowed
The most common cause for this error is returning objects and collections from request.*()
functions. Other possible causes include unnecessary drawing updates, excess historical
buffer capacity, or inefficient use of max_bars_back.
Returning collections from request.*() functions
A common source of the “Memory limits exceeded” error is returning objects or collections
from another chart symbol or timeframe using request.*() functions.
When requesting data from other contexts, the data for each bar is copied and stored in
memory to allow the script to reference it later in the main context. This can use a lot of
memory, depending on the data. Requesting large collections can easily lead to excessive
memory consumption.
Let’s look at an example script where we request data to calculate the balance of power
(BOP) for the symbol at a higher timeframe. Here, the request expression is a custom function
that populates a persistent array with our calculated BOP values, returning the full array to the
main context on each bar. We intend to use these stored array values to calculate and plot the
average BOP in the main context. However, returning every array instance consumes a lot of
memory, and so this script can throw a memory error on charts with a sufficiently long history:
How do I fix this?
Optimize requests and limit the data returned to the main context to ensure that only the
minimum necessary data is stored in memory.
If possible, try to return calculated results directly rather than returning the collections
themselves, or only return collections conditionally, when they are necessary in the main
context.
Let’s consider a few common scenarios where scripts need specific data in the main context.
Return last state only
If a script needs only the last state of a requested collection in the main context: use an if
barstate.islast condition to return a copy of the last bar’s collection only.
Here, we modified our script to display only the latest average BOP (a single value), rather
than plotting an average line. The updated request function now returns the calculated BOP
values directly for each bar, and returns the higher timeframe’s array only on the last bar:
Return calculated results
If a script needs the result of a calculation on a collection, but does not need the collection
itself in the main context, use a user-defined function as the request expression. The function
can calculate on the collection in the requested context and return only the result to the main
context.
For example, we can calculate the average BOP directly within our request function.
Therefore, only the calculated values are stored in memory, and the request expression
returns a tuple (current BOP and average BOP) to plot the results in the main context:
Return the collection on some bars
If a script needs the collection itself in the main context, but not for every bar, use conditional
expressions to return only the necessary collections to the main context, returning na
otherwise. The logic in the main context can then address the na gaps in the series and
perform its desired actions on the reduced collections.
For example, if we want to calculate the average BOP across each month instead of using a
user-input length, we can return the array from the requested context only when there is a
change to a new month, returning na otherwise. We then maintain the previous month’s
values in the main context to keep a valid array for all intra-month bars:
Other possible error sources and their fixes
There are a few other ways to optimize scripts to consume less memory.
Minimize request.*() calls
The request.*() function calls can be computationally expensive, because they retrieve data
from other contexts, which can often require significant resource usage. Excessive or
inefficient requests can easily cause scripts to reach the memory limit.
This memory consumption is especially substantial for scripts requesting data from lower
timeframes, where the request function returns an array of multiple lower timeframe bars for
each main context bar. For example, requesting “1” data on a “1D” chart returns hundreds of
“1” bars for each “1D” bar that executes the request. In the process, the script must allocate
memory to store all the requested data arrays so that it can access them later in the main
context, which quickly increases the memory consumption.
Programmers can reduce the number of requested expressions by:
Removing unnecessary request.*() function calls.
Changing the requested timeframe to a higher resolution.
Condensing multiple requests to the same context into a single request.*() call.
Adjusting the request.*() function’s calc_bars_count parameter to restrict the
historical data points in the requested context.
See this section in the User Manual for more information on optimizing request.*() calls.
Refrain from using max_bars_back unless necessary
The max_bars_back parameter of an indicator or strategy sets the size of the history buffer
for all series variables in a script. The history buffer determines the number of historical
references stored in memory for the script’s built-in and user-defined variables.
By default, the Pine Script™ runtime automatically allocates an appropriate buffer for each
variable. Therefore, the max_bars_back parameter and function are only necessary when Pine
cannot determine the referencing length of a series.
If you encounter this referencing length error, ensure that you set the max_bars_back value
appropriately to your script’s needs. Setting a value that’s too large can lead to excessive
memory consumption, as it stores unnecessary historical data that the script ultimately
doesn’t use. Read up on how to optimize using max_bars_back in our Help Center.
Minimize historical buffer calculations
The Pine Script™ runtime automatically creates historical buffers for all variables and function
calls in a script. It determines the size of a buffer based on the historical references needed in
the code (the references made using the [] history-referencing operator).
As the script runs across the dataset, referencing distant points in bar history can cause the
script to restart its execution on previous bars to adjust its historical buffer size (see this User
Manual article to learn more). Larger buffers in turn lead to an increase in memory
consumption and can result in a runtime error. Ensure that scripts are referencing necessary
historical values only, and avoid referencing very distant points in history when possible.
You can use the indicator() function’s calc_bars_count parameter or the max_bars_back()
function to manually restrict the historical data capacity on a script-wide or variable-specific
scale. However, be aware that these methods can also cause memory consumption issues of
their own if used improperly.
Reduce drawing updates for tables
Tables only display their last state on a chart. Any updates to a table on historical bars are
redundant, because they are not visible. To use the least memory, draw the table once, and fill
it on the last bar.
Use the var keyword to declare table objects once. Enclose all other setter function calls in a
conditional if barstate.islast block for better performance. For more about tables, see this
User Manual article.
Do not update drawings on historical bars
Similar to tables, any updates to drawing objects such as lines and labels that are made on
historical bars are never seen by the user. The user only sees updates on realtime bars.
Eliminate updates to historical drawings during historical bars wherever possible. For more
information, see this User Manual section.
Minimize total drawings stored for a chart
Drawing objects such as lines and labels can consume a lot of memory, especially if a script
recreates drawings unnecessarily.
For example, if a script draws a line from point x1 to x2 , then needs to update the line’s
endpoint ( x2 ), it’s more computationally expensive to delete the existing line and redraw a
new line from x1 to x3 . Instead, using the setter function line.set_x2() to update the
existing line’s endpoint is more efficient.
Look for ways to optimize drawing objects in a script:
Reduce the number of redrawn objects by initializing drawing object identifiers and
using their setter functions to modify properties.
Remove unnecessary chart drawings using the delete() functions (e.g., line.delete()
and label.delete()).
Reduce an indicator’s maximum drawings limit using the max_lines_count or
max_labels_count parameters.
Filter dates in strategies
The total number of trades or orders in a strategy can impact the memory consumption of a
script. For large datasets, reduce the number of unnecessary historical orders stored in
memory by limiting the starting point of your strategy.
You can filter the strategy’s date by adding a conditional expression that compares the bar
time to a specified timestamp to only place entry/exit orders beyond a certain date.
See an example of date filtering in strategies here.

User Manual / Release notes Release notes This page contains release notes describing notable changes to the Pine Script™ experience. 2024 November 2024 Introducing Pine Script™ v6 Pine Script™ has graduated to v6! Starting today, future Pine updates will apply exclusively to this version. Therefore, we recommend converting existing v5 scripts to access new features as we roll them out. See our migration guide to understand the changes to existing Pine behaviors and learn how to convert scripts to v6. Several new features and behaviors come with this version’s release: Scripts can now call request.*() functions with “series string” arguments for the parameters that define the requested context, meaning a single request.*() call can change its requested data feed on any historical bar. Additionally, it is now possible to call request.*() functions inside the local scopes of loops, conditional structures, and exported library functions. See the Dynamic requests section of the Other timeframes and data page to learn more. Values of the “bool” type are now strictly true or false . They are never na in v6. Additionally, the or and and operators now feature short-circuit (“lazy”) evaluation. If the first expression of an or operation is true , or the first expression of an and operation is false , the script does not evaluate the second expression because it is not necessary to determine the result. These improvements help boost the runtime efficiency of scripts that rely on “bool” values and conditional expressions. The size property of labels and the text_size property of boxes and tables now support “int” values in addition to the size.* constants. These “int” values represent sizes in typographic points, offering a more granular and wide range of text size possibilities. The new text_formatting parameter of the label.new(), box.new(), and table.cell() functions determines whether the object’s displayed text is bold, italicized, or both. It accepts one of these three new text.* constants: text.format_bold, text.format_italic, text.format_none. To modify a drawing object’s text_formatting property, use the corresponding *set_text_formatting() functions. Strategies no longer stop calculating and raise an error when they reach the 9000 trade limit while not using Deep Backtesting mode. Instead, they trim the oldest orders to make space for new ones. The trimmed orders are not visible in the Strategy Tester, but that does not change the strategy’s simulation. To retrieve the trade index of the earliest non-trimmed order, use the strategy.closedtrades.first_index variable. The array.get(), array.set(), array.insert(), and array.remove() functions now support negative index arguments to reference elements starting from the end of an array. For instance, the call array.get(myArray, -2) retrieves the second to last element in myArray , which is equivalent to array.get(myArray, array.size(myArray) - 2) . The new syminfo.mincontract variable holds a value representing the smallest number of contracts/shares/lots/units required to trade the current symbol, as set by the exchange. Two new variables, syminfo.main_tickerid and timeframe.main_period, reference the ticker ID and timeframe from the script’s main context, even if the script uses them in the expression argument of a request.*() call. Here, “main context” refers to the current chart’s symbol and timeframe, unless the script is an indicator() that includes symbol or timeframe arguments in its declaration statement. October 2024 We’ve added an optional behind_chart parameter to the indicator() and strategy() functions. This parameter specifies where plots and drawings appear relative to the main chart display when the overlay parameter is true . If behind_chart is true , the script’s visuals appear behind the chart display. If false , they appear in front of the chart display. The default is true . August 2024 The ticker.new() and ticker.modify() functions feature two new parameters: settlement_as_close and backadjustment . Users can specify whether these parameters are on, off, or set to inherit the symbol’s default settings. These settings only affect the data from futures symbols with these options available on their charts. They have no effect on other symbols. The backadjustment parameter specifies whether past contract data on continuous futures symbols is back-adjusted. Its possible values are: backadjustment.on, backadjustment.off, or backadjustment.inherit. The settlement_as_close parameter specifies whether a futures symbol’s close value represents the actual closing price or the settlement price on “1D” and higher timeframes. Its possible values are: settlement_as_close.on, settlement_as_close.off, or settlement_as_close.inherit. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios in the Strategy Tester module have updated calculations. Previously, the ratios used strategy returns over monthly periods if the trading range was three or more months and daily periods if the range was three or more days but less than three months. Both ratios now always use monthly periods for consistency. June 2024 We’ve added a new parameter to the box.new(), label.new(), line.new(), polyline.new(), and table.new() functions: force_overlay - If true, the drawing will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. Optional. The default is false. Pine Script™ Enums Enums, also known as enumerations, enumerated types, or enum types, are unique data types with all possible values declared by the programmer. They can help programmers maintain more strict control over the values allowed by variables, conditional expressions, and collections, and they enable convenient dropdown input creation with the new input.enum() function. See our User Manual’s Enums page to learn more about these new types and how to use them. May 2024 We’ve added an optional calc_bars_count parameter to the indicator(), strategy(), request.security(), request.security_lower_tf(), and request.seed() functions that allows users to limit the number of recent historical bars a script or data request can execute across. When a script’s indicator() or strategy() declaration statement includes a calc_bars_count argument, its “Settings/Inputs” tab will include a “Calculated bars” input in the “Calculation” section. The default value in all these functions is 0, which signifies that the script or request executes across all the available data. The strategy.* namespace features several new built-in variables: strategy.avg_trade - Returns the average amount of money gained or lost per trade. Calculated as the sum of all profits and losses divided by the number of closed trades. strategy.avg_trade_percent - Returns the average percentage gain or loss per trade. Calculated as the sum of all profit and loss percentages divided by the number of closed trades. strategy.avg_winning_trade - Returns the average amount of money gained per winning trade. Calculated as the sum of profits divided by the number of winning trades. strategy.avg_winning_trade_percent - Returns the average percentage gain per winning trade. Calculated as the sum of profit percentages divided by the number of winning trades. strategy.avg_losing_trade - Returns the average amount of money lost per losing trade. Calculated as the sum of losses divided by the number of losing trades. strategy.avg_losing_trade_percent - Returns the average percentage loss per losing trade. Calculated as the sum of loss percentages divided by the number of losing trades. Pine Profiler Our new Pine Profiler is a powerful utility that analyzes the executions of all significant code in a script and displays helpful performance information next to the code lines inside the Pine Editor. The Profiler’s information provides insight into a script’s runtime, the distribution of runtime across significant code regions, and the number of times each code region executes. With these insights, programmers can effectively pinpoint performance bottlenecks and ensure they focus on optimizing their code where it truly matters when they need to improve execution times. See the new Profiling and optimization page to learn more about the Profiler, how it works, and how to use it to analyze a script’s performance and identify optimization opportunities. Pine Editor improvements When opening the detached Pine Editor from a tab with a chart, it now links directly to that tab, as indicated by the “Linked” status and green icon in the bottom-right corner. While linked, the “Add to chart”, “Update on chart”, and “Apply to entire layout” buttons affect the charts on the main tab. The detached Pine Editor now includes the Pine console. April 2024 We’ve added a new parameter to the plot(), plotchar(), plotcandle(), plotbar(), plotarrow(), plotshape(), and bgcolor() functions: force_overlay - If true, the output will display on the main chart pane, even when the script occupies a separate pane. March 2024 The syminfo.* namespace features a new built-in variable: syminfo.expiration_date - On non-continuous futures symbols, returns a UNIX timestamp representing the start of the last day of the current contract. The time() and time_close() functions have a new parameter: bars_back - If specified, the function will calculate the timestamp from the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on its timeframe. It can also calculate the expected time of a future bar up to 500 bars away if the argument is a negative value. Optional. The default is 0. February 2024 We’ve added two new functions for working with strings: str.repeat() - Constructs a new string containing the source string repeated a specified number of times with a separator injected between each repeated instance. str.trim() - Constructs a new string with all consecutive whitespaces and other control characters removed from the left and right of the source string.
New math constants were added:
math.pi - is a named constant for Archimedes’ constant. It is equal to
3.1415926535897932.
math.phi - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal to

access the future data by default. This can be changes with the lookahead
parameter.
An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was replaced with an
implicit conversion of numeric values (integer and float) to boolean values.
Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed. Any PineScript
code that used those language constructions can be equivalently rewritten using
mutable variables.
February 2017
Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report:
New Buy & Hold equity graph — a new graph that lets you compare performance
of your strategy versus a “buy and hold”, i.e if you just bought a security and held
onto it without trading.
Added percentage values to the absolute currency values.
Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold Equity based on
last price.
Added Sharpe Ratio — it shows the relative effectiveness of the investment
portfolio (security), a measure that indicates the average return minus the risk-free
return divided by the standard deviation of return on an investment.
Slippage lets you simulate a situation when orders are filled at a worse price than
expected. It can be set through the Properties dialog or through the slippage
argument in the strategy() function.
Commission allows yot to add commission for placed orders in percent of order
value, fixed price or per contract. The amount of commission paid is shown in the
Commission Paid field. The commission size and its type can be set through the
Properties dialog or through the commission_type and commission_value
arguments in the strategy() function.

strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and cancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies
allow you to perform backtesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and
forward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data) according to your
algorithms. Detailed information about the strategy’s calculations and the order fills can
be seen in the newly added Strategy Tester tab.
July 2015
A new editable parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style menu in the indicator
settings so that it is not possible to edit its style. The parameter has been added to all

a certain condition.
Similar to the barcolor() function, the bgcolor() function changes the color of
the background.
Reworked the security() function, further expanding its functionality.
Improved the fill() function, enabling it to be used more than once in one
script.

Pine Script™ v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( ``line.new`` and ``l
In v6, seriesLen is correctly parsed as a “series int” type, and raises a compilation error if
passed in place of the expected “simple int” argument for length .
Fix: Pass values of the expected qualified type to built-in functions. In our example, set the
length argument to a “const int” value.
Color changes
The color values behind some of the color.* constants have changed in Pine v6 to better
reflect the TradingView palette:
Constant name Pine v5 color Pine v6 color
color.red #FF5252 #F23645
color.teal #00897B #089981
color.yellow #FFEB3B #FDD835
Additionally, the default text color for label.new() is now color.white in v6 (previously
color.black in v5) to ensure that the text is more visible against the default color.blue
label.
Strategies
Removal of when parameter
The when parameter for order creation functions was deprecated in v5 and is removed in v6.
An order is created only if the when condition is true , which is its default value. This
parameter affects the following functions: strategy.entry(), strategy.order(), strategy.exit(),
strategy.close(), strategy.close_all(), strategy.cancel(), and strategy.cancel_all().
The following example strategy shows the use of the when parameter, and works in v5 but
not v6.
Fix: To trigger the order creation conditionally, use if statements instead.
Default margin percentage
The default margin percentage for strategies is now 100.
In v5, the default value of the margin_long and margin_short parameters is 0, which means
that the strategy does not check its available funds before creating or managing orders. It
can create orders that require more money than is available, and will not close short orders
even when they lose more money than available to the strategy.
In Pine v6, the default margin percentage is 100. The strategy does not open entries that
require more money than is available, and short orders are margin called if too much money is
lost.
For example, we can see the difference in strategy behavior by running this simple strategy
on the “ARM” symbol’s 4h chart using the v5 and v6 default margin values. When using Pine
v5, there are no margin calls:
However, if we adjust this script to //@version=6 on the same chart, we see that it triggers
14 margin calls because of the new margin percentages:
Fix: To replicate the previous v5 behavior, set the strategy() function’s margin_short and
margin_long arguments to 0.
Excess orders are trimmed
Strategy orders above the 9000 limit are trimmed (removed) in v6.
In v5, outside of Deep Backtesting, when a strategy creates more than 9000 orders, it raises a
runtime error and halts any further calculations.
For example, this strategy script places several orders on each bar in the dataset. As a result,
it can quickly surpass the 9000 order limit and trigger an error in Pine v5:
In v6, when the total number of orders exceeds 9000, the strategy does not halt. Instead, the
orders are trimmed from the beginning until the limit is reached, meaning that the strategy
only stores the information for the most recent orders.
Trimmed orders no longer show in the Strategy Tester, and referencing them using the
strategy.closedtrades.* functions returns na. Use strategy.closedtrades.first_index to get
the index of the first non-trimmed trade:
History-referencing operator
Pine v6 contains several changes to referencing the history of values.
No history for literal values
The history-referencing operator [] can no longer be used with literal values or built-in
constants.
In v5, the history-referencing operator [] can be used with built-in constants, such as true
and color.red , and with literals, which are raw values used directly in a script that are not
stored as variables, such as 6 or "myString" , etc.
However, referencing the history of a literal is usually redundant, because by definition every
literal represents a fixed value. The only exception where the returned historic value may vary
is if the historical offset points to a non-existent bar, in which case referencing the historic
literal value returns na.
In Pine v6, you can no longer use the history-referencing operator [] on literals or built-in
constants. Trying to do so triggers a compilation error.
Fix: Remove any [] operators used with literals or constants.
History of UDT fields
The history-referencing operator [] can no longer be used directly on fields of user-defined
types.
In v5, you can use the history-referencing operator [] on the fields of user-defined types.
While this does not cause any compilation errors, the behavior itself is erroneous.
For example, the script below draws an arrow label on each bar and displays its percentage
increase/decrease. The label style, color, and text are set based on a bar’s direction ( close >
open ). The script defines a UDT LblSettings to initialize an object on each bar that stores
these settings. On the last bar, it draws a table cell that displays the arrow direction and
percentage difference from 10 bars back. In v5, we could use the history-referencing operator
[] on the required LblSettings fields directly:
In Pine v6, you can no longer use the history-referencing operator [] on the field of a userdefined
type directly.
Fix: Use the history-referencing operator on the UDT object instead, then retrieve the field of
the historic object. To do so, use the syntax (myObject[10]).field - ensure the object’s
historical reference is wrapped in parentheses, otherwise it is invalid. Alternatively, assign the
UDT field to a variable first, and then use the history-referencing operator [] on the variable
to access its historic value.
Therefore, we can adjust the v5 code to access a historic instance of our infoObject on the
last bar, wrapped in parentheses. Then, we retrieve our desired field values from the historic
object (infoObject[10]) to display the arrow direction and percentage difference from 10
bars back:
Timeframes must include a multiplier
The timeframe.period variable holds a “string” that represents the chart’s timeframe, typically
consisting of a quantity (multiplier) and unit.
In v5, the timeframe.period variable does not include a quantity when the chart timeframe has
a multiplier of 1 . Instead, the string consists of only the timeframe unit, e.g., "D" , "W" ,
"M" . This is inconsistent with the timeframe strings for these same units at higher intervals,
e.g., "2D" , "3M" .
To simplify the timeframe format in v6, the timeframe.period variable now always includes a
multiplier with its timeframe unit. So, "D" becomes "1D" , "W" becomes "1W" , and "M"
becomes "1M" .
This change might affect the behavior of older scripts that used == to compare the value of
timeframe.period with the “string” representation of a timeframe directly (e.g.,
timeframe.period == "D" ).
To show the difference between the v5 and v6 timeframe.period variables, we ran the script
below on a daily chart (1D) for each Pine version. The script displays the timeframe.period
string in a table, and compares the variable’s value with the “string” literals "D" and "1D" :
Fix: In general, ensure that all timeframe strings include a multiplier. In this example, change
the timeframe comparison “string” ( timeframe.period == "D" ) to ensure the “string” literal
includes a multiplier ( timeframe.period == "1D" ).
Lazy evaluation of conditions
The and and or conditions are now evaluated lazily rather than strictly.
An and condition is true if all of its arguments are true , which means that if the first
argument is false , we can deduce that the whole condition is false , regardless of the
value of the second argument. Conversely, an or condition is true when at least one of the
arguments is true , so if the first argument is already true , then the whole condition is
true , regardless of the second argument’s state.
Pine v5 evaluates all bool expressions except for the ?: ternary operator strictly, meaning
the second part of a conditional expression is always evaluated, regardless of the value of the
first argument.
Lazy evaluation can have consequences for script calculation. In the example below, we
assign a value of true to the signal variable only when close > open and ta.rsi(close,
14) > 50 . The ta.rsi() function must be executed on every bar in order to calculate its result
correctly. In v5, the function is called on every bar, even when close > open is not true ,
due to the strict bool evaluation, and therefore the function calculates correctly.
In v6, bool expressions are evaluated lazily, which means the expression stops evaluating
once it determines the overall condition’s result, even if there are other arguments remaining
in the expression.
If we convert the script above to v6, we see that the plotted signals differ between the two
scripts. This variation occurs because of the lazy bool evaluation – since an and condition is
only true if all its arguments are true , when close > open is false , the and condition is
definitely false regardless of the second argument. ta.rsi(close, 14) > 50 .
Consequently, the ta.rsi() call is not evaluated on every bar, which interferes with the internal
history that the RSI function stores for its calculation and results in incorrect values:
Fix: Ensure that the script evaluates all functions that rely on previous values on each bar. For
example, extract calls that rely on historical context to the global scope and assign them to a
variable. Then, reference that variable in the and and or conditions.
Note that you can and should take advantage of the lazy bool evaluation to create smarter,
more concise code.
For example, the script below calls array.first() on an array that is occasionally empty (on bars
where close > open is false ). In Pine v5, calling array.first() on an empty array results in a
runtime error, so you must keep the two if-conditions that check the array size and first
element separated in different scopes to avoid the error. However, in Pine v6, you can have
the two conditions in the same scope without error because the and condition’s lazy
evaluation ensures that array.first() will only be called if array.size() != 0 is true
first:
Cannot repeat parameters
In v5, you can specify the same parameter in a function more than once. However, doing so
raises a compiler warning, and only the first value will be used.
In v6, you can specify a parameter only once, and doing otherwise will result in a compilation
error.
Fix: Remove the duplicate parameters.
No series offset values
The offset parameter can no longer accept “series” values
In Pine v5, the offset parameter in plot() and similar functions can accept “series int”
arguments. However, passing a “series” argument raises a compiler warning, and the behavior
is incorrect: only the last calculated offset is used on the whole chart, regardless of its
previous values.
For example, this script uses bar_index / 2 as a “series” offset argument while plotting
the high points of each bar’s body. Because the plot() function uses only the last offset
value, the plot appears offset by 10 bars here for the entire “GOOGL” 12M chart (since the
chart’s last bar_index is 20 here):
In v6, the offset parameter accepts an argument qualified as “simple” or weaker. The value
used must be the same on every bar.
Remember that the Pine Script™ qualifiers hierarchy means that a parameter expecting a
“simple” value can also accept values qualified as “input” or “const”. However, passing a
“series” argument triggers a compilation error.
Fix: Change any “series” values passed to offset to “simple” values.
Minimum linewidth is 1
In v5, the linewidth parameter of the plot() and hline() functions can accept a value smaller
than 1, although the width on the chart will still appear as 1 for these drawings:
In v6, the linewidth argument must be 1 or greater. Passing a smaller value causes a
compilation error.
Fix: Replace any linewidth argument that is smaller than 1 to ensure all width values are at
least 1.
Negative indexes in arrays
Some array functions now accept negative indexes.
In v5, array functions that require an element’s index always expect a value greater than or
equal to 0. Therefore, functions like array.get(), array.insert(), array.set(), and array.remove()
raise a runtime error if a negative index is passed.
In v6, array.get(), array.insert(), array.set(), and array.remove() allow you to pass a negative
index to request items from the end of the array. For example, -1 refers to the last item in
the array, -2 refers to the second to last, and so forth.
As a result, scripts that return a runtime error for using negative indices in v5 can be executed
without error in v6.
However, if you create or update a script in v6, you must be aware of this new behavior to
ensure that the script does not behave unexpectedly.
Keep in mind that negative indexing is still bound by the size of the array. Therefore, an array
of 5 elements only accepts indexing from 0 to 4 (first to last element) or -1 to -5 (last to first
element). Any other indexes are out of bounds and raise a runtime error:
The transp parameter is removed
In Pine v4 and earlier, plot() and similar functions had a transp parameter that specified the
transparency of the resulting plot.
Pine v5 deprecated and hid the transp parameter, because it is not fully compatible with the
color system that Pine currently uses. Using both transparency settings together can result in
unexpected behavior, as the transp parameter can get overwritten by the transparency of
the color passed to the function. In v5, using the color.new() function and not the transp
parameter avoids any such conflicts.
Pine v6 removes the transp parameter completely from the following functions: bgcolor(),
fill(), plot(), plotarrow(), plotchar(), and plotshape(). Whenever the converter encounters a
transp argument, it removes the argument from the converted v6 script.
Fix: To set the transparency of a drawn plot, use the color.new() function. Pass the color
value as the first argument, and the desired transparency value as the second.
For example, this v5 code uses the hidden transp parameter to set the color of the plot to
80 transparency:
In Pine v6, the same result can be achieved using color.new():
If you need to preserve the color inputs in the “Settings/Style” menu, you must ensure that
every color that gets passed to every color.new() call is qualified as either “const” or “input”. If
at least one of these color values is calculated dynamically (like the code above), the color
selector does not appear in the settings:
You can learn more about why this happens and how to avoid it here.

User Manual / Migration guides / To Pine Script™ version 5
To Pine Script™ version 5
Introduction
This guide documents the changes made to Pine Script™ from v4 to v5. It will guide you in
the adaptation of existing Pine scripts to Pine Script™ v5. See our Release notes for a list of
the new features in Pine Script™ v5.
The most frequent adaptations required to convert older scripts to v5 are:
Changing study() for indicator() (the function’s signature has not changed).
Renaming built-in function calls to include their new namespace (e.g., highest() in v4
becomes ta.highest() in v5).
Restructuring inputs to use the more specialized input.*() functions.
Eliminating uses of the deprecated transp parameter by using color.new() to
simultaneously define color and transparency for use with the color parameter.
If you used the resolution and resolution_gaps parameters in v4’s study(), they will
require changing to timeframe and timeframe_gaps in v5’s indicator().
v4 to v5 converter
The Pine Editor includes a utility to automatically convert v4 scripts to v5. To access it, open a
script with //@version=4 in it and select the “Convert to v5” option in the “More” menu
identified by three dots at the top-right of the Editor’s pane:
Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v4 to v5. If you want to convert the script
manually or if your indicator returns a compilation error after conversion, use the following
sections to determine how to complete the conversion. A list of some errors you can
encounter during the automatic conversion and how to fix them can be found in the Common
script conversion errors section of this guide.
Renamed functions and variables
For clarity and consistency, many built-in functions and variables were renamed in v5. The
inclusion of v4 function names in a new namespace is the cause of most changes. For
example, the sma() function in v4 is moved to the ta. namespace in v5: ta.sma().
Remembering the new namespaces is not necessary; if you type the older name of a function
without its namespace in the Editor and press the ‘Auto-complete’ hotkey ( Ctrl + Space , or
Cmd on MacOS), a popup showing matching suggestions appears:
Not counting functions moved to new namespaces, only two functions have been renamed:
study() is now indicator().
tickerid() is now ticker.new().
The full list of renamed functions and variables can be found in the All variable, function, and
parameter name changes section of this guide.
Renamed function parameters
The parameter names of some built-in functions were changed to improve the nomenclature.
This has no bearing on most scripts, but if you used these parameter names when calling
functions, they will require adaptation. For example, we have standardized all mentions:
The full list of renamed function parameters can be found in the All variable, function, and
parameter name changes section of this guide.
Removed an `rsi()` overload
In v4, the rsi() function had two different overloads:
rsi(series float, simple int) for the normal RSI calculation, and
rsi(series float, series float) for an overload used in the MFI indicator, which did a
calculation equivalent to 100.0 - (100.0 / (1.0 + arg1 / arg2)) .
This caused a single built-in function to behave in two very different ways, and it was difficult
to distinguish which one applied because it depended on the type of the second argument. As
a result, a number of indicators misused the function and were displaying incorrect results. To
avoid this, the second overload was removed in v5.
The ta.rsi() function in v5 only accepts a “simple int” argument for its length parameter. If
your v4 code used the now deprecated overload of the function with a float second
argument, you can replace the whole rsi() call with the following formula, which is
equivalent:
Note that when your v4 code used a “series int” value as the second argument to rsi(), it was
automatically cast to “series float” and the second overload of the function was used. While
this was syntactically correct, it most probably did not yield the result you expected. In v5,
ta.rsi() requires a “simple int” for the argument to length , which precludes dynamic (or
“series”) lengths. The reason for this is that RSI calculations use the ta.rma() moving average,
which is similar to ta.ema() in that it relies on a length-dependent recursive process using the
values of previous bars. This makes it impossible to achieve correct results with a “series”
length that could vary bar to bar.
If your v4 code used a length that was “const int”, “input int” or “simple int”, no changes are
required.
Reserved keywords
A number of words are reserved and cannot be used for variable or function names. They are:
catch , class , do , ellipse , in , is , polygon , range , return , struct , text ,
throw , try . If your v4 indicator uses any of these, rename your variable or function for the
script to work in v5.
Removed `iff()` and `offset()`
The iff() and offset() functions have been removed. Code using the iff() function can be
rewritten using the ternary operator:
Note that the ternary operator is evaluated “lazily”; only the required value is calculated
(depending on the condition’s evaluation to true or false ). This is different from iff(),
which always evaluated both values but returned only the relevant one.
Some functions require evaluation on every bar to correctly calculate, so you will need to
make special provisions for these by pre-evaluating them before the ternary:
The offset() function was deprecated because the more readable [] operator is equivalent:
Split of `input()` into several functions
The v4 input() function was becoming crowded with a plethora of overloads and parameters.
We split its functionality into different functions to clear that space and provide a more robust
structure to accommodate the additions planned for inputs. Each new function uses the name
of the input.* type of the v4 input() call it replaces. E.g., there is now a specialized
input.float() function replacing the v4 input(1.0, type = input.float) call. Note that you
can still use input(1.0) in v5, but because only input.float() allows for parameters such as
minval , maxval , etc., it is more powerful. Also note that input.int() is the only specialized
input function that does not use its equivalent v4 input.integer name. The input.*
constants have been removed because they were used as arguments for the type
parameter, which was deprecated.
To convert, for example, a v4 script using an input of type input.symbol , the input.symbol()
function must be used in v5:
The input() function persists in v5, but in a simpler form, with less parameters. It has the
advantage of automatically detecting input types “bool/color/int/float/string/source” from the
argument used for defval :
Some function parameters now require built-in
arguments
In v4, built-in constants such as plot.style_area used as arguments when calling Pine
Script™ functions corresponded to pre-defined values of a specific type. For example, the
value of barmerge.lookahead_on was true , so you could use true instead of the named
constant when supplying an argument to the lookahead parameter in a security() function
call. We found this to be a common source of confusion, which caused unsuspecting
programmers to produce code yielding unintended results.
In v5, the use of correct built-in named constants as arguments to function parameters
requiring them is mandatory:
To convert your script from v4 to v5, make sure you use the correct named built-in constants
as function arguments.
Deprecated the `transp` parameter
The transp= parameter used in the signature of many v4 plotting functions was deprecated
because it interfered with RGB functionality. Transparency must now be specified along with
the color as an argument to parameters such as color , textcolor , etc. The color.new() or
color.rgb() functions will be needed in those cases to join a color and its transparency.
Note that in v4, the bgcolor() and fill() functions had an optional transp parameter that used
a default value of 90. This meant that the code below could display Bollinger Bands with a
semi-transparent fill between two bands and a semi-transparent backround color where
bands cross price, even though no argument is used for the transp parameter in its
bgcolor() and fill() calls:
In v5 we need to explictly mention the 90 transparency with the color, yielding:
Changed the default session days for `time()` and
`time_close()`
The default set of days for session strings used in the time() and time_close() functions, and
returned by input.session(), has changed from "23456" (Monday to Friday) to "1234567"
(Sunday to Saturday):
This change in behavior should not have much impact on scripts running on conventional
markets that are closed during weekends. If it is important for you to ensure your session
definitions preserve their v4 behavior in v5 code, add ":23456" to your session strings. See
this manual’s page on Sessions for more information.
`strategy.exit()` now must do something
Gone are the days when the strategy.exit() function was allowed to loiter. Now it must actually
have an effect on the strategy by using at least one of the following parameters: profit ,
limit , loss , stop , or one of the following pairs: trail_offset combined with either
trail_price or trail_points . When uses of strategy.exit() not meeting these criteria
trigger an error while converting a strategy to v5, you can safely eliminate these lines, as they
didn’t do anything in your code anyway.
Common script conversion errors
Invalid argument ‘style’/‘linestyle’ in ‘plot’/‘hline’ call
To make this work, you need to change the “int” arguments used for the style and
linestyle arguments in plot() and hline() for built-in constants:
See the Some function parameters now require built-in arguments section of this guide for
more information.
Undeclared identifier ‘input.%input_name%’
To fix this issue, remove the input.* constants from your code:
See the User Manual’s page on Inputs, and the Some function parameters now require built-in
arguments section of this guide for more information.
Invalid argument ‘when’ in ‘strategy.close’ call
This is caused by a confusion between strategy.entry() and strategy.close().
The second parameter of strategy.close() is when , which expects a “bool” argument. In v4, it
was allowed to use strategy.long an argument because it was a “bool”. With v5, however,
named built-in constants must be used as arguments, so strategy.long is no longer allowed
as an argument to the when parameter.
The strategy.close("Short", strategy.long) call in this code is equivalent to
strategy.close("Short") , which is what must be used in v5:
See the Some function parameters now require built-in arguments section of this guide for
more information.
Cannot call ‘input.int’ with argument ‘minval’=‘%value%‘. An
argument of ‘literal float’ type was used but a ‘const int’ is
expected
In v4, it was possible to pass a “float” argument to minval when an “int” value was being
input. This is no longer possible in v5; “int” values are required for “int” inputs:
See the User Manual’s page on Inputs, and the Some function parameters now require built-in
arguments section of this guide for more information.

To Pine Script™ version 4
To Pine Script™ version
4
This is a guide to converting Pine Script™ code from
@version=3
to
@version=4
.
Converter
The Pine Editor comes with a utility to automatically convert v3 indicators and strategies tov4. To access it, open a script with
//@version=3
in it and select the
Convert to v4
optionin the
More
dropdown menu:
Not all scripts can be automatically converted from v3 to v4. If you want to convert the scriptmanually or if your indicator returns a compilation error after conversion, consult the guidebelow for more information.
Renaming of built-in constants, variables, and
functions
In Pine Script™ v4 the following built-in constants, variables, and functions were renamed:
Color constants (e.g
red
) are moved to the
color.*
namespace (e.g.
color.red
).
The
color
function has been renamed to
color.new
.
Constants for
input()
types (e.g.
integer
) are moved to the
input.*
namespace(e.g.
input.integer
).
The plot style constants (e.g.
histogram
style) are moved to the
plot.style_*
namespace (e.g.
plot.style_histogram
).
Style constants for the
hline
function (e.g. the
dotted
style) are moved to the
hline.style_*
namespace (e.g.
hline.style_dotted
).
Constants of days of the week (e.g.
sunday
) are moved to the
dayofweek.*
namespace (e.g.
dayofweek.sunday
).
The variables of the current chart timeframe (e.g.
period
,
isintraday
) are moved tothe
timeframe.*
namespace (e.g.
timeframe.period
,
timeframe.isintraday
).
The
interval
variable was renamed to
timeframe.multiplier
.
The
ticker
and
tickerid
variables are renamed to
syminfo.ticker
and
syminfo.tickerid
respectively.
The
n
variable that contains the bar index value has been renamed to
bar_index
.
The reason behind renaming all of the above was to structure the standard language toolsand make working with code easier. New names are grouped according to assignments undercommon prefixes. For example, you will see a list with all available color constants if you type‘color’ in the editor and press Ctrl + Space.
Explicit variable type
declaration
In Pine Script™ v4 it’s no longer possible to create variables with an unknown data type at thetime of their declaration. This was done to avoid a number of issues that arise when thevariable type changes after its initialization with the na value. From now on, you need toexplicitly specify their type using keywords or type functions (for example,
float
) whendeclaring variables with the na value:

User Manual / Migration guides / To Pine Script™ version 3
To Pine Script™ version 3
This document helps to migrate Pine Script™ code from @version=2 to @version=3 .
Default behaviour of security function has
changed
Let’s look at the simple security function use case. Add this indicator on an intraday chart:
This indicator is calculated based on historical data and looks somewhat into the future. At
the first bar of every session an indicator plots the high price of the entire day. This could be
useful in some cases for analysis, but doesn’t work for backtesting strategies.
We worked on this and made changes in Pine Script™ version 3. If this indicator is
compiled with //@version=3 directive, we get a completely different picture:
The old behaviour is still available though. We added a parameter to the security function
(the fifth one) called lookahead .
It can take on the form of two different values: barmerge.lookahead_off (and this is the
default for Pine Script™ version 3) or barmerge.lookahead_on (which is the default for Pine
Script™ version 2).
Self-referenced variables are removed
Pine Script™ version 2 pieces of code, containing a self-referencing variable:
Compiling this piece of code with Pine Script™ version 3 will give you an Undeclared
identifier 's' error. It should be rewritten as:
s is now a mutable variable that is initialized at line 3. At line 3 the initial value gives the Pine
Script™ compiler the information about the variable type. It’s a float in this example.
In some cases you may initialize that mutable variable (like s ) with a na value. But in
complex cases that won’t work.
Forward-referenced variables are removed
In this example f is a forward-referencing variable, because it’s referenced at line 3 before it
was declared and initialized. In Pine Script™ version 3 this will give you an error Undeclared
identifier 'f' . This example should be rewritten in Pine Script™ version 3 as follows:
Resolving a problem with a mutable variable in a
security expression
When you migrate script to version 3 it’s possible that after removing self-referencing and
forward-referencing variables the Pine Script™ compiler will give you an error:
Cannot use mutable variable as an argument for security function!
This limitation exists since mutable variables were introduced in Pine Script™, i.e., in version
2. It can be resolved as before: wrap the code with a mutable variable in a function:
Math operations with booleans are forbidden
In Pine Script™ v2 there were rules of implicit conversion of booleans into numeric types. In
v3 this is forbidden. There is a conversion of numeric types into booleans instead (0 and na
values are false , all the other numbers are true ). Example (In v2 this code compiles fine):
Variables s , s1 and s2 are of bool type. But at line 6 we add three of them and store the
result in a variable sum . sum is a number, since we cannot add booleans. Booleans were
implicitly converted to numbers ( true values to 1.0 and false to 0.0 ) and then they
were added.
This approach leads to unintentional errors in more complicated scripts. That’s why we no
longer allow implicit conversion of booleans to numbers.
If you try to compile this example as a Pine Script™ v3 code, you’ll get an error: Cannot call
`operator +` with arguments (series__bool, series__bool); <...> It means that you
cannot use the addition operator with boolean values. To make this example work in Pine
Script™ v3 you can do the following:
Function bton (abbreviation of boolean-to-number) explicitly converts any boolean value to
a number if you really need this.
