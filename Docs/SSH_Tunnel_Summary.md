# SSH Tunnel and Reverse Proxy Setup Summary

## Components Created

1. **Tunnel Script (`start_ssh_tunnel.sh`)**
   - Establishes a secure SSH tunnel between the jamso-ai-server and the cPanel server
   - Uses reverse port forwarding to make the backend service accessible from cPanel
   - Includes error handling and retry logic

2. **Reverse Proxy (`reverse_proxy.py`)**
   - Runs on the cPanel server
   - Forwards HTTP/HTTPS requests from trading.colopio.com to the SSH tunnel
   - Filters requests by domain to ensure only trading.colopio.com is affected
   - Handles all HTTP methods and properly passes headers and body content

3. **WSGI Adapter (`passenger_wsgi.py`)**
   - Integrates with cPanel's Passenger WSGI infrastructure
   - Starts the reverse proxy in a separate thread
   - Provides health check endpoints

4. **Monitoring Script (`monitor_ssh_tunnel.sh`)**
   - Checks if the SSH tunnel is active and functioning
   - Restarts the tunnel automatically if it fails
   - Logs actions for troubleshooting

5. **Deployment Script (`deploy_cpanel_proxy.sh`)**
   - Packages and transfers all necessary files to the cPanel server
   - Creates required directory structure
   - Sets proper permissions

6. **Systemd Service (`ssh-tunnel.service`)**
   - Ensures the SSH tunnel starts automatically on boot
   - Restarts the tunnel if it fails
   - Provides proper security constraints

7. **Documentation (`SSH_Tunnel_Setup.md`)**
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Security considerations

## Implementation Steps

1. **On the Backend Server (jamso-ai-server)**
   - Configure SSH key authentication with the cPanel server
   - Deploy the scripts and systemd service
   - Add cron job for monitoring

2. **On the cPanel Server**
   - Set up the Python application using the provided scripts
   - Configure the domain to use the Python application

## Security Features

- Domain filtering ensures only trading.colopio.com requests are processed
- SSH key authentication prevents unauthorized access
- The tunnel only exposes the specific service port (5000)
- Regular monitoring detects and repairs any issues

## Next Steps

1. Test the connection from the public internet to trading.colopio.com
2. Monitor logs for any errors or unusual activity
3. Set up alerts for tunnel failures

## Customization Options

- Change the port numbers if needed
- Add additional domains to the allowed list if required
- Modify the proxy to add custom headers or transformations
