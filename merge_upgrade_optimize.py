Jamso AI Engine â€“ Merge, Upgrade & Optimization Automation Script

This script automates the process of analyzing, comparing, merging, upgrading, and documenting the Jamso AI Engine app and its secondary version.

Features:
- Compares all files and folders between main and secondary versions
- Logs all actions, differences, and decisions
- Integrates valuable changes from the secondary version
- Refactors and reorganizes for clarity and scalability
- Removes redundant or outdated code
- Runs tests and logs results
- Generates MERGE_LOG.md and TODO.md/NOTES.md

Usage:
    python merge_upgrade_optimize.py
