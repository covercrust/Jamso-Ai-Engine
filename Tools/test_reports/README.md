# API Integration Test Reports

This directory contains the automated test reports generated by the `test_integration.py` script.

## Report Types

Two types of reports are generated for each test run:

1. **JSON Reports**: Detailed technical reports with comprehensive test data
   - Filename format: `integration_test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
   - Contains all test details, performance metrics, and system information

2. **Text Summary Reports**: Human-readable summaries of test results
   - Filename format: `integration_test_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
   - Contains high-level test outcomes and system information

## Reading Reports

### JSON Reports

JSON reports contain detailed information about each API test:

- Test timestamps and durations
- Status of each API test (success/error)
- Detailed error information when tests fail
- Performance metrics for API calls
- System information for troubleshooting

### Text Summary Reports

Text reports provide a human-readable overview:

- Date and time of the test run
- Duration of the entire test suite
- Summary of test results for each API
- Pass/fail counts
- System information

## Using Reports for Troubleshooting

When an API test fails:

1. Check the text summary first to identify which API failed
2. Look at the JSON report for detailed error information
3. Note any performance metrics that may indicate timeouts or slow responses
4. Use the system information to verify the testing environment was correct

## Retry Failed Tests

You can retry only the tests that failed in the previous run:

```bash
python3 ../test_integration.py --retry-failed
```

## Automated Report Management

Old reports are not automatically deleted. You may want to periodically clean up this directory to save disk space.
